This project aims to identify incentivised reviews from all reviews posted on Amazon e-commerce website. Incentivised reviews are reviews of those users who have received giveaways/samples/freebies/discounted goods from seller in exchange for positive reviews. In this project, we will analyse how to use regular expressions, tokenization, lemmatization, topic modelling to identify incentivised reviews. Note : This project is still ongoing.
