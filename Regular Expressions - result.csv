6580,1427291,"sample some of the manufacturer's other products. I really enjoy macadamia nuts and thought the Macadamia with Cashews butter would be a good product to try. This product is made with just two ingredients -- macadamias and cashews -- and I can say that this product demonstrates what a healthy, good for you food should taste like.<br /><br />The macadamia cashew butter is easily retrieved from the container. There was some oil separation but after a little stirring, one can take a butter knife and quickly spread the substance on a piece of toast or apple slices. When looking at the butter, you will see little pieces of nuts which makes this product product have some texture. This macadamia cashew butter is not as chunky as most chunky peanut butters; the chunks in this product are much finer. I found the flavor to be very much influenced by the raw cashews and actually considered my jar to be more of a cashew butter than a macadamia butter.<br /><br />It is recommended that this product be refrigerated for a longer life.<br /><br />While not noted explicitly on the product's label, I could see nothing that would contradict my belief that this is a vegan product. There is no milk, honey, eggs or other animal-based substances that go into the formulation of this product. According to the product packaging, this product is \\""made in a facility that processes tree nuts and soy, but does not process peanuts, gluten, dairy, cholesterol or GMO's.\\""  As a side note, if you are allergic to cashews, I have not found one of Artisana's butters to be absent of cashews.<br /><br />Artisana products are delicious and simple in their composition.  Since purchasing the macadamia nut butter, I have sampled the pecan, cashew and walnut butters.  With the exception of the cashew butter, I would buy them all again. For holiday gift giving, I'm definitely going to be packaging several of Artisana's products in gift baskets. They are tasty, natural and unique.<br /><br />This product is made in the United States.<br /><br />A note on another place to buy this product, iherb.com.  I turn to iherb.com with frequency to purchase Artisana products.  Sometimes Amazon has the best price and sometimes iherb.com has the best price.  iherb.com has free"

You can watch for 5 minutes straight before it disconnects you (plenty of time), and you can always restart the feed with a single button press on your iPhone. I don't know why it disconnects you after 5 minutes, but it may be to do with keeping the heat down on the camera sensor etc. After all, SkyBell isn't designed to be a dedicated surveillance system or anything.<br /><br />A few updates and this could easily be a 5-star product.

Early varieties I chose were truly horrid, clearly designed for people who had no choice- shaped correctly, but odd of color; and chewy, with a texture and taste that could in no way be considered acceptable or in some cases even recognizable. And could overpower almost any sauce.<br /><br />I recently discovered a relatively major brand on the grocery store pasta shelf now had a GF spaghetti. I gave it a try and was optimistic. It was not completely the right color, but close, which I considered a good sign. I found the taste and texture to be not a whole lot worse than any other brand of normal boxed pasta that had been sitting on a shelf for years and then served undercooked.<br /><br />I was pleased to see that now Barilla had thrown their capellini into the ring, as it were- despite their personal views on family life in America, they are still considered one of the world’s major pasta manufacturers. I figured it could be no worse.<br /><br />I cooked a batch of the Barilla, the Ronzoni, and some stale non-GF Barilla I had sitting around. As I expected, they were more or less the same, which is a good thing, I guess. Unfortunately, it was a bit harder to cook the texture on the GF correctly, it seemed to go from a sort of “al dente” to “slime” a lot more quickly than the non. Seemed to be no matter how it was cooked, to be a little bit more chewy than non GF. Taste? Right out of the pot, it seemed just a bit- off somehow. Not bad, but since I was unable to get it to a familiar consistency, just- off. Next came a bit of olive oil, then later a simple white sauce, and ultimately a full-on Bolognese. And obviously, the deeper the sauce, I would have to say the substitution would unlikely be detected.<br /><br />Do not forget that for the purpose of this review"

But I have found that if I take a Nutrigold maca cap after noon, I don't find it as easy to wind down as I'd like in the evening before bed, so I'm careful about that. I also found that for me, 1 a day is enough, though the suggested use section of the label says adults can take 1 cap 3 times daily. I haven't tried maca long enough to know if one can develop tolerance with regular use.

So your video starts with a nice titled introduction with embedded video (or picture) in a smaller bubble to introduce the segment.  There are lots of tools, filters / lenses, and options at your disposal.  Although with more options comes some amount of confusion and complexity at first.  More options and power doesn't make for quick editing.  The video conversions & combining might be optimized, but the time to actually work on your project will take some time.  This is not as intuitive or quick to do simple editing jobs as some simpler editors that just let you quickly trim/split/cut/combine/convert video.  It doesn't simply browser or organize your existing media library, but you can drag in anything to start working on it in a project.  But if you want to take the time to really work on something, then this offers the tools that help you do something really professional.<br /><br />The software starts with a getting started pop up with links to video tutorials to help you get started.  I strongly advise you to watch them if you are new (like me) to advanced editing tools, or you can be overwhelmed or confused about what to do and how to do it.  But it really isn't too bad.  But if you are expecting to just find your videos and start doing quick editing with them, this isn't the case.  For example, my Sony Camcorder comes with really good simple software that finds and browses all my videos easily, and can trim/cut/split/combine/convert videos as just the video files that they are.  But with this, you work within a project, and can drag/drop files into a story board, work on them from there, work on it to perfections, then produce the result.  But if you wanted to make a longer video like a wedding video with separately titled scenes, then this software can do far more than the simple camcorder software cannot.  So if you are looking only for an incremental step up from your existing editing tool, this one is just something suited for the larger picture than quick editing.

This isn't actually such a problem for me, as my media player (Asus O!Play) lets me compensate for this by advancing or retarding the sound.  Other commenters have said this conversion delay contributes to the lag, but that's not it.  Unfortunately Senheiser are also buffering the sound, presumably chopping it up into packets prior to radio transmission.  This is the only explanation I can come up with, just like an mp3 player does for it's encoding blocks (which will add a further delay if listening to such material).  So this isn't the final story, and it seems there's another generation of devices that needs to get introduced before we finally get wireless movie sound that anyone could consider 'videophile' (if such a word exists).  But the above isn't the reason why I'm seriously thinking of returning these.  It's the sound drop-outs during quiet periods.  How incredibly stupid to produce a pair of phones at this price, and add a feature which changes the sound representation, but not provide any means of disabling it!

Although it has a bit more of a poppyh feel thanks to Mouse T's \\""Horny\\""... I rememebr when that song was pumping!  Still have the cd single!  But it starts out a bit weaker than disc one, including a rehash of Stardust's cut that opened disc one.  But once Teardrops kicks and \\""Sugar is Sweeter\\"", that remix that's now timeless kicks, you're on a throbbin' trance journey.  \\""Sunchyme\\"", the trance mix brings me back to club nights at \\""Avalon\\"" and also in England, whlie \\""Higher State of Consciousness\\"" had the deep, dark electronic element to the music that was just cool.  It preceeds Camisra's wildly popular \\""Let Me Show You\\"" from that time frame before the real gem of the double disc set kicks in - the cut that put Jan Johnston on the match ' \\""Skydive\\"".  The tune still gives me chills when I hear it in the car.  What's added to this is how it was so appropriately followed by \\""Ayla\\""... and the correct mix at that!  Then comes \\""Amazon Chant\\"" to somewhat wind down the trance mood - another tune that I loved before closing out with Fatboy Slim's hit \\""Rockafeller Skank\\"".<br /><br />With such a glowing review"

It's anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-biotic, and deeply moisturizing.  Research shows that it relieves pain, fades scars, cures acne, heals burns, reduces pain from arthritis and neuralgia, and regenerates skin.  Like most oils, it's rich in lipids (fatty acids) and vitamin E.<br /><br />Leia Naturals Tamanu oil comes in a dark glass bottle, which protects it from oxidizing.  It has a convenient pump dispenser which allows it to be dispensed drop by drop without any waste.  It's pure organic, cold pressed, unrefined virgin oil and it's mixed with a carrier oil.<br /><br />I used this oil on my dry, scaly elbows and did see a marked improvement after just a few days.  It absorbed quickly and didn't leave my skin sticky or oily. It was also very nice as a moisturizer after I shaved my legs.  I used a few drops of it brushed through my hair before bed, and when I shampooed in the morning my hair felt hydrated and soft. I also tried using a drop or two as an anti-frizz serum, and when I used the blow dryer on it my hair was shiny and had more body. The pleasant nutty fragrance reminded me of linseed oil, although the scent isn't overpowering.  I didn't try it on a cut or burn so I can't say how it works medicinally, but as a moisturizer and beauty oil I like it a lot.  This 1 ounce (30 ml) bottle will last a long time, and the price makes it comparable to other beauty oils I've used.  Leia Naturals also guarantees you'll love this oil, or they'll refund your money.<br /><br />If you have nut allergies, you should not use tamanu oil.  My daughter tried it on the dry skin underneath her eyes and had some redness and irritation the next day.  I didn't have any reactions from using it, but I don't have any known allergies.<br /><br />I received a complimentary sample of tamanu oil for testing"

35228,147006,"sample that I viewed during a presentation by LG at which a number of other people were also in attendance. I was fortunate to be able to take my own video of the TV and had about an hour of hands-on time with it after the presentation was over.<br /><br />When I first saw this TV, it was sitting right next to a top-of-the-line 4k Samsung UHD TV (Samsung HU9000). It literally took me only 2 seconds to determine that the LG had such a superior picture quality that I was sold on the spot. There is an insignificant amout of bezel on the screen so it looks awesome with the picture filling nearly the entire screen.<br /><br />For roughly the same amount of money as a 4k UHD LCD TV, you can buy this TV with  OLED technology that blows other LCD/LED TV's away. It's not a close call... it's a profoundly superior picture that can be seen easily by even someone unfamiliar with the technology.<br /><br />What I (and you) will first notice when you view this TV is that blacks are black... not dark gray but black. The reason that blacks on the OLED are so superior to all other LCD/LED TV's is that LCD screens employ a backlight. The backlight must be on for you to see anything at all and it is that backlight that prevents an LCD/LED TV from developing true black. Black always looks dark gray and it always will as long as there is a backlight.<br /><br />The LG OLED TV does not have a backlight. That is why the blacks are black. And the carry through with this is that overall contrast is so much better too, that it is impossible not to notice... even when a top-of-the-line 4k UHD TV is sitting right next to the LG displaying the exact same content.<br /><br />So blacks are black, contrast is superior, colors are brighter and truer, flesh tones are more realistic. Again, not slightly better but blow your socks off better.<br /><br />I also noticed how much better the LG OLED TV is when viewed off axis. With an LCD TV, as  soon as you start to view the TV from anywhere other than a few degrees from dead center, you start losing sharpness, brightness, color, everything. The picture degrades significantly. With the LG, you can move to such a sharp angle and never lost picture quality. It's quite amazing and this can be seen clearly.<br /><br />The LG OLED TV is only about 32 pounds without the stand and 37 pounds with the stand. The stand is aluminum, not plastic. It is solid and beautifully sculpted. The screen is even thinner than my iPhone5s. The screen is in thin because it doesn't have to have the backlight which makes LCD screens thicker. There is a thicker area of the TV however and that is where the electronics, ports, speakers, attachment to the base,  are located<br /><br />The internal speakers in the TV, although not producing fantastic sound, are not too bad for built-in speakers. They are downward facing and on the bottom of the TV. The sound hits the aluminum pedestal which projects the sound outward. So it's not too bad. But I'll definitely get a soundbar or surround system at some point to maximize the sound. With a picture this fine, you don't want mediocre sound.<br /><br />The remote is small and feels good in the hand. It operates from 2-AA batteries. A microphone is built-in to the remote. The remote has motion-sensing and is used when using the WebOS and for setting up the TV. It works really well. You can also program the remote to recognize known Set-Top boxes, Blu-ray players, Home Theater and Sound Bars using the Device Manager function of the TV<br /><br />Connections in and out of the TV are generous. Some of the highlights are that you get 4-HDMI inputs. 3-USB2 inputs, composite and component video inputs, optical digital output, and more. Check out the LG website for all the tech specs and more detail than I can provide in this short review"

It did a nice job on these, but I was not convinced it was all that much better than my old standby or crushing them in my hand.<br /><br />Dried Cloves (2/5) Again, a bit of a workout. The small size makes it tough for me to get a real good grip, and more than a couple cloves was almost more than I could grind. Again the result was almost 100% pencil-point sized shavings, which were bigger than I wanted.<br /><br />Summary- For me, couldn't really find a niche where I could balance the negatives of having one more kitchen gadget in the drawer versus the positives of what it could do. You may have a much different tolerance for gadgets, or a bigger drawer, so make your own tradeoff. The unit is nicely made, and except for the cheap-looking box with the big computer label on it, would make a reasonable gift presentation.<br /><br />It does work as designed, and smaller female hands may find it easier to handle than mine did.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this unit as an evaluation"

I even like fan fiction.  That being said, I want to be able to lose myself in the story.  On that level, this book failed.<br /><br />One of the first lessons for a writer of fiction is learning the difference between telling and showing. This book is all talk. Much of the story line didn't make sense and some of it was simply unbelievable. There are too many coincidences, the romance didn't work, the dialogue was stilted, the characters flat. We don't get to know Kate, so we don't really care what happens to her (other than a basic human reaction that we don't want to see someone murdered). Overall, the author is very heavy-handed with her characters, and that is never a good thing.<br /><br />I do agree with the review"

The result was a perfect, creamy Neutrogena face wash that smells heavenly and rinses off without a lot of residue. So this pump helped me use something I would have probably tossed in the trash at some point.

Our two cats have been living on various \\""high end\\"" dry cat foods for some time now (e.g., the \\""Before Grain\\"" foods in chicken, tuna and salmon versions, and some fancy pantsy \\""Duck a l'orange\\"" stuff from our local pet shop).  They have not been partial to canned foods, nor have I often gone the canned food route because it is less than convenient and didn't seem worth the candle since they seem to favor dry food (and mice and birds and whatever else they can glean from our little acre in the woods).  They typically start out loving canned food, but after a few bites, the rest sits in the bowl and dries out before we toss it and go back to the dry food they've grown to love.    However, both of our cats are smitten by this stuff.  It looks like real food out of the can, with large chunks of fish and seafood in a thickened broth.  It doesn't have the strong fishy smell of most canned foods and looks like something I could almost be tempted to eat my self in a pinch.  The 3 ounce size makes it perfect for a \\""treat\\"" for the cats between feedings of dry food and they leave nothing behind when we dump a can in their dish (with some added hot water as they really love the broth).    But I'm not sure I want my cats eating this stuff for the same reason I don't want my eight year old eating at fast food franchises, much as she might love the food and snarf it up in a flash -- I'm concerned this food may not be a healthy thing for the animal eating it or for the planet. Seeing \\""Made in Thailand\\"" emblazoned on the box made me immediately wonder whether this stuff might include ingredients banned in the US or could otherwise be manufactured without adequate regulation of methods and materials.

At once, the track explodes in sort of a proggy haze, and with a choir of vocals it works quite well.<br /><br />\\""Don't Save Us From The Flames\\"" is only one of several tracks where the group pushes forward into a territory that seems to delight in more of a throwback feel. As piles of buzzing synths squeal, a full-on drum attack rambles along as falsetto vocals recall 70s groups like Journey. The track is propulsive and has great dynamics, though, and almost does enough to keep some of the comparisons off your mind while tracks like \\""Can't Stop\\"" seem to rub the cheese factor in your face with new-age synth washes and pitter-patter tom fills (along with pitch-bent vocals).<br /><br />In other places, the group seems to really unleash their more rock side, and the blistering \\""*\\"" is a wonderful example of what they can do with dense layers of squealing synths married to rock guitars and driving drums. \\""Car Chase Terror\\"" uses a similar formula, only substiting some movie dialogue in place of the slower parts before ramping things up to a fever pitch. Considering the album uses several spoken-word passages, the track still sounds a bit out-of-place with its darker subject matter. Unfortunately, while Before The Dawn Heals Us makes the tradeoff of being much more varied in terms of overall sound, it also feels a smidge more inconsistent. There are several songs on the release that are easily among the best that the group has ever done, but by the time the 15 tracks and well over an hour run length are over, the release feels a bit on the long side and many of the shorter tracks simply feel like sketches that weren't fully fleshed-out.

Whoever said playing video games is like a job these days wasn't kidding...it's not even just a normal 9-5, it's one of those jobs where your boss pages you in the middle of the night and any hope for job advancement requires picking up his dry cleaning and a number of other ridiculous and unnecessary, IRRELEVANT tasks.<br /><br />There is one glimmer of light in the unlockable system. There are a variety of ways to purchase items now. They have hack points, which are beside the normal in-game currency (something denoted by an F-symbol). Instead of doling out the numerous ducats (dutch currency--since I don't know and am too lazy to research the F-symbol's meaning) you can instead spend hack points to purchase any item you might desire. For example, one of the better swords in the game costs 125,000F or 1000H. I don't yet know how the transactions goes from start-to-finish since I haven't spent any yet. But I think it's cool that you get an alternative to get to your desired destination, if you will.<br /><br />I am about 6 hours in, been exploring like crazy so probably only about 1-2 hours into the main story's progress but I am finally starting to have some fun.

In the console game, you'll find what are called&#34;nomad&#34; points. Accessing these is what gives the companion app's nomad brotherhood missions and it's self-explanatory from there. In case you are having issues finding these missions in the companion app. If you are sure that you have already accessed a nomad point in the Unity console version, then hit the home button on the companion app (upper right-hand corner) and then peruse the map for some green hexagonal icons that will likely be shimmering, a beacon for your attention. Hope this helps!<br /><br />Vol. 2--A New Hope...but it's on life-support<br /><br />Man, guys--I'm really trying to like this game but it would be hard for me to recommend purchase to anybody apart from diehard fans of the franchise who are committed to continuing the main story arc. The game not only crashes itself and requires frequent resets but it also causes the xboxOS to crash as well, requiring hard power cycling. There are unusually-long load times. This is really starting to go beyond the point of ridiculous because the game seems like it was prematurely released and arguably not tested by any external, unbiased 3rd parties or even in-house because if it had been I don't think it would carry the amount of problems that it has.<br /><br />Additionally and tragically, throughout the entire course of gameplay all I can think is 'what a bumbling disaster of controllability and monumental quality-control failure.' The best adjectives to describe interacting in both combat and the surrounding environment would be clumsy, clunky, dysfunctional. I'm talking about spending 3-5 seconds positioning yourself perfectly, merely to open a chest or any other interactable object in the environment. It's only a couple seconds but having to fumble around an object just to interact with it is a gameplay no-no. They need to fix the proximity area where players become eligible to successfully interact with objects.<br /><br />Combat is just wow. Anybody who played the first game might recall that given an opponents stance, there was either a way to proactively break their defensive posture to execute an attack or reactively counter their attack. There was simply an answer for any given enemy type and how they were facing you, whether offensively or defensively. Through the evolution of the series this has steadily gone away. I'm finding this game to be a button masher and it's just really breaking my heart. I'm fixed on waiting to see how the next release in the series will review"

I can honestly say each track is interesting for different reasons.

87086,3302904,"sample images attached of one camera taking a picture of the other camera in the same lighting conditions.<br /><br />First things first, I plugged the creative camera into my monitor and it was immediately recognized by MAC OS X.  I used photobooth to take pictures from both cameras.  What I found interesting at this point was that when the creative was plugged in, it took preference and was the default camera...even though the logitech was still plugged in.  Very interesting.<br /><br />The pictures: I can tell you that, without a doubt, the creative has better autofocus control and the lighting looks better.  The logitech looks 'yellowish'.  My untrained eye suggests that the pictures from the creative web cam are far superior.  Mind you, both of these units have small lenses and so no masterpiece will come out of them...but as far as web cams go the Creative seems to have more of a natural look and not an overexposed yellowish look.<br /><br />The video: While I dont think that a web-cam should be used to capture high end video, this unit can be used to capture video at 640x480 and then up-converted to 1600x1200 using the included software.  The upconversion is a useless feature for me since I believe that web-cam video at 640x480 is PERFECT for the time being.  We are not doing HD broadcasts with web-cams are we?  If we need higher video broadcast quality then we should be using real cameras that can send out hq video.<br /><br />Skype Test: I am sure all of you know what Skype is so I wont get into any details.  I made a test call with Skype to my office and made sure that the person on the other end was paying attention to the image detail.  First it was the creative and then the logitech.  Here are the comments from the other end: \\""The first video was much clearer and I could see that you have not shaved today, The second video looked like you were sitting in the SUN and hid the scruff on your face.  The first was clearly better!\\""  Enough said if you ask me.  Now granted this was only one test call..but sometimes that is enough to tell you what you need to know.  This was tested over a Cable Modem connection (Comcast) that has about 15mbps down and 2mbps up. A variety of other programs were running while skyping (is that a word?).<br /><br />Background music was playing at a nominal volume so as to check if noise canceling and adaptive microphones worked properly, it did!  The other party did hear the music when I was not speaking but said the music drowned out immediately when my voice was being transmitted.<br /><br />Physical Aspects:<br />The creative unit comes on a clear acrylic base which you can simply siton your desk.  It also does however have a curved design at the bottom which allows you to place it on top of a monitor.  (The logitech also has these features, but the creative looks sharper!).  The camera can be rotated about 270 degrees.  It has two microphones to the left of the lens so that it can clearly pick up your voice and cancel out the noise...(this was also tested in the skype chat with background music playing).<br /><br />Software:  I personally do not feel the need to install extra software on my system but I must inform you that is available and adds a few features to the camera.  Here are a few of the key points:<br />1. Parental Control - so you can lock the camera from being used.<br />2. Avatars - You are able to use avatars and add video and voice effects to your video chats.  This feature also allows you to create avatars from your own pictures.<br /><br />The software is not a necessity on any system that can recognize USB devices, primarily newer operating systems that have camera support built in.  However, please note that the software will be required if you want to use the parental lock features and if you want your images to be upconverted (interpolated) from 2.0mp to 8.0mp.<br /><br />Overall this camera has proven to be clearly superior to the Logitech and in my testing"

I've only used it for trips around town, so far, so I need more time to give it a thorough test, but I thought I would go ahead and post some information which may be helpful to some of you. My initial impressions are good.  The user interface is probably the easiest to use of any of my GPS devices.  Screen is bright and clear.  Everything works as expected.<br /><br />In local trips, the tracking seems very accurate, no issues there.  The volume is adequate, but could be better.  Using the FM transmitter worked well for me and had enough volume.  Background static was only objectionable when the volume was turned up loud.  Even better, I tried using a cassette adapter which worked very well and gave great sound.  However, most of the time I just used the internal voice and speakers and they were acceptable.<br /><br />The Voice Recognition (VR) is the hot feature for this unit and I found it to work very well.  Quite impressive, actually.  It required no \\""training\\"" and had a high degree of accuracy.  It is the best VR I've seen yet on any portable device.  Good enough to actually be useful.  One prime example, I can use VR to \\""Zoom In\\"" and \\""Zoom Out\\"" (merely by saying those phrases) of the map while driving.  I also found it worked very well to find locations on the fly.  For example, you can say \\""Find Nearest Mexican Restaurant\\"" and it will show a list, then you just pick (by saying the number) and \\""Go!\\"" -- very handy!  For the current price, this feature alone is worth the price of admission.<br /><br />So far, the navigation and routing has been fine, but I need to do more testing"

I have having to listen to these, so I skip over them, but they're still annoying.<br /><br />The cooldowns on the workouts are also much too short, but I know that that's because they're trying to keep the workouts at just about thirty minutes each. Plan on spending a few more minutes stretching out and cooling down.<br /><br />~~ OVERALL THOUGHTS ~~<br /><br />Because I was eating a lot fewer carbs (I only got two yellow containers a day) than I usually do, I \\""boinked\\"" during a few workouts my first week, which is really unlike me.  Usually I do 45- to 60-minute intense workouts with no problem, but the different way of eating really made a difference in my performance during the workouts.  I had originally thought that I would add a short half-hour yoga session to each workout (I did this with Jillian Michaels' BodyShred and it worked well), but I was spent after doing each 21DFX workout, and didn't have the energy to add anything else on.  One of my friends who was also doing 21DFX suggested I bump into the next higher calorie bracket, so I did that a few days so I could have more energy, and it seemed to help.<br /><br />I really liked these workouts much more than the workouts from the original set.  The time flies by in most of them, and I gave myself the challenge of sticking with the workouts and meal plan for just three weeks, knowing I would soon be back to my more-loved workouts soon enough.<br /><br />I'll update this tomorrow, once I do my final measurements and weigh-in.<br /><br />~~FINAL RESULTS/TAKEAWAYS -- UPDATE ON 2/28/15~~<br /><br />I just took my final measurements, and lost two pounds and 3 1/4\\"" overall.  That may not seem like a lot since I know that some folks have gotten pretty dramatic results with the original 21DF set, but I'm already on the smaller size and the Extreme program helped me tighten up.  I lost two inches (!!) on my waist, 1/2\\"" off my hips, and about 1/4\\"" off each thigh.  (Pants that were tight on me around Christmas are now much looser in the waist.)<br /><br />I'm still really happy with those results since I'm an hourglass and can bulk up easily.  Right before doing 21DFX, I did three weeks of Jillian Michaels' new BodyShred program, and, while I LOVED the BodyShred workouts, I put on a half-inch on each thigh in just three weeks, and I've had a hard time taking those inches off.<br /><br />After three weeks of 21DFX, I also have more muscle definition (for instance, I can see the muscle lines in my forearms and in my abs much more), and I feel more toned overall.<br /><br />Also, I was really good with measuring out my portions and sticking to my containers the first two weeks of 21DFX, but was really indulgent with my eating the third week, and so my results weren't as great as I had hoped they'd be -- but that's completely my fault.  What I did learn from the program is that I was definitely eating more carbs and fruits before starting 21DFX than I should be eating if I want fat loss.  I also saw that as soon as I started re-introducing my snacking at night in Week 3 (things like Kettle Korn and some pieces of chocolate), the weight loss stalled.<br /><br />For me personally, I love working out (it's one of my main hobbies), but have struggled with my weight (especially since turning 40 a few years ago), and so this program really helped me see what I needed to do with my diet to get results.  When I was in my 20's and 30's, I could eat whatever I wanted to as long as I did tough workouts, but, as I've gotten older, I've come to see more and more that I really need to focus on my eating in order to see results.  Using the container system really helped me see that -- that \\""abs really are made in the kitchen.\\"" :-)<br /><br />When I do this program again, I may just use it for two weeks at a time since I seem to have a hard time sticking to carb-restricted eating plans for much longer than that, and will probably use it before going on vacation and when coming back from vacation.<br /><br />~~ FINAL REMARKS ~~<br /><br />If you have any questions about the set or the workouts, please leave them in the comments section below, and I'll try my best to answer them. Sorry for the length of this review"

147964,2660912,"sample of Elizabeth Gilbert's The Signature of All Things and was immediately hooked.  Henry's coming-of-age story, and Alma's childhood reminded me of something from Charles Dickens, a literary classic.  Honestly, I could not get enough of the botany - who knew plants were so fascinating?!?!  It was exciting to feel like I was learning while loving these characters.<br /><br />The book shifted midway when Mrs. Gilbert follows Alma, Prudence, and their bestie, through their adulthood and into middle age, but I still loved it, however I missed the beginning.  Then the book shifts again when Alma is older - don't want to give plot points away, but it becomes more of a struggle between science and metaphysical.  Interesting, but kind of random, but then kind of meticulous in how it all ties together.  Interesting is the word I will use to describe it and leave it at that with no other judgment.<br /><br />I applaud Mrs. Gilbert for taking a risk.  Her writing is beautiful and I found myself re-reading paragraphs because they were like poems.  Her description is unparalleled with anything else I've read lately, and I found myself lost in her story and characters more than once, with them haunting me when I wasn't reading.  I literally feel like I've travelled the world through her book and I'm grateful.<br /><br />I must admit I was not a fan of Eat, Pray, Love, to give anyone reading this review"

The track doesn't always work, but it is close enough and Yamin sings the hell out of it either way. The bridge is cool where everything seems to click for perhaps the first time within the song and I understand the reason why the producers and Yamin LIKED and PICKED the track; it is fun (or theoretically so) and it changes the pace of the album from merely being urban or adult contemporary.<br /><br />\\""Take My Breath Away\\"" has a nice six-feel to it and an incredibly soulful feel.

173492,472249,"sample rate.<br />Don't expect too much from pro tools SE, it's a very very basic version, the first thing that I notice is the lack of the monitoring by software, fast track has direct monitoring by hardware, but I record guitars and you hear only the clean signal, if you use any effects you cannot monitoring at playback  only when recording mode...and there are many features hidden that you can discover by reading the help, but you cannot find in any part of the menu.  It comes with a huge  collection of loops and virtual instrument that I don't use (I mainly play and record guitars) so I cannot to say to much about that.....so I still and prefer to use reaper like my main DAW!!!  the web site of avid don't have to much information about this version of pro tools, you cannot try a demo, sorry by that. If you are looking for get into the serious pro tools world  I recommend to check avid mbox interface instead. This interface is not usb 2.0....is usb 1 compatible with usb 2.0, always run at usb 1 speed.<br />Another thing that I take some time to deal was driver issues with nvidia graphics and motherboard intel chipset 945, you're gonna have pops and really annoying hiss sound randomly, but this is common with external usb sounds cards and graphics drivers on some configurations, you have to use your onboard graphics or deal with nvidia tools to tune your graphics card. I already had this trouble with another usb sound card, so it was no big issue for me, but I read really bad review"

Tactile feel and very good build quality though the touchscreen gets ruined without the not included plastic cover/sticker. Exceptionally good build quality.<br /><br />7. While the 3.2 megapixel camera is quite a disappointment, the zoom no longer ruins the photograph as much. Improved zoom.<br /><br />8. Wireless works even though the browser is corrupt and buggy.<br /><br />9. Big fonts when typing a message<br /><br />10. Ear volume is satisfactory and the phone catches signals well. It is also light to carry.<br /><br />11. trackid - This phone has trackid. If a song is playing around you and you wish to know the name, trackid allows you to record a sample, within a few seconds of the sample being sent, you will get the name of the song. It all takes much less than a minute.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />1. Most lacklusture ensemble of menu, shortcuts and files<br />2. Doesn't come with mp4 playback software which means no videos. It still records in gp3 and though the videos were of good quality, video playback software (divx) was very buggy on this phone and never worked for me.<br />3. Where is the torch? I miss it.<br />4. Battery life has dismal written all over it. Try talking 3hours and 20 mins on a single charge and you'll remember Jesus of Nazareth. I had to keep reducing the brightness to 19% and what not. 65% is default brightness.<br />5. The general feel of the menu gets worse every month and it becomes more and more prone to mistakes. To navigate there is a little joystick like navigation button on the left which is annoying and cheap. I don't even use it enough because my friend said his broke for his w950i and his girlfriend's did the same. You can't help but feel cheated because the menu is nowhere near as good as the Iphone.<br />6. The bundled earphones are same as the ones you get with the other walkman series and there is nothing different. This is annoying because SE are trying to save money and develop a standard and at the same time expect six hundred dollars for this phone<br />7. The camera is inferior to W810i and there are simply too many shades and blindspots when viewed on my computer. I have to photoshop photographs which are shot in dark light and personally increase contrast. Don't even think of comparing the Nokia N95 camera to this. The iphone camera likes to make images look a little brighter and livelier unlike this nincompoop.<br />8. The ringtone needs to be better tuned because the phone likes to do a little 8-10 second jig before it starts playing the mp3 you have selected as your ring tone.<br />9. The card scanner hardly works and the buttons for the walkman (touchscreen) are annoying.<br /><br />If by this time you are wondering if I'm easy to annoy, then well I am if I feel I am robbed of my money. This phone is clearly the worst disaster and misuse I have made of my dad's hard earned funds.<br /><br />10 ***BIG FLAW*** If you were to use the earphones on this phone, you will find that the output of the volume is about 35% as loud as the W810i. I simply cannot believe this nor accept it. This major flaw aggrevates me. I have tried different earphones and headphones but they have actually reduced the output volume and they have the nerve to call this a walkman phone. I used an N-Series phone the other day and I am not kidding but it was five times as loud with earphones. Terrible effects if I were to someday take this phone to gym as a stand-alone mp3 player.<br /><br />11. A free"

178905,3331486,"sample. All opinions are mine.    Our kids LOVE technology. They love our phones and tablets and always want to play with them. However, we rarely allow them the treat of playing on our devices.  There are too many what ifs available on a regular tablet or cell phone.  What if the buy a lot of games on the store?  What if they access the internet and run across something dangerous or inappropriate?  What if they accidentally drop, step on or lose my tablet?    The Vtech Innotab Max solves these problems and provides my kids the luxury of having their own tablet.  Loaded with learning titles and a few games, I can hand them the Innotab without any worries.  They can play and learn without my worrying.  As a homeschooling family it is a wonderful treat for them to play after a day of studies and an excellent tool for refreshing their skills on vacation days.    My two children, ages 7 and 9, both enjoy using the tablet.  Each child has the ability to login into their personal account and play a few favorites.  My 7 year old loves playing math and reading games and doesn't realize that he is actually playing learning games.  The nine year is addicted to creating.  The video camera and camera applications allow him to explore his creative side.  He loves to spend time editing videos and pictures.    I love the security of the Vtech Innotab. The case is sturdy and can withstand the rough treatment of my children.  The screen isn't going to crack with a simple drop.  The parental controls allow me to monitor the usage and what my children are playing.  I'm in complete control and yet they feel the free"

181979,228867,"sample camera.  So it may not be a problem in other OM-d cameras.  But I ended up returning the camera.  I will add that when I took pictures of flowers and other objects from 2 to 10 feet away, the autofocus was very accurate and the pictures were crisp.  But the Canon G1X exhibits less noise at high ISO.<br /><br />If I didn't have the autofocus problem I would give this camera 4.5 stars.  So if the problem was just with my sample, then I would highly recommend the camera.  But I can only rate it based on the sample I bought...and for that it gets a 3 (demoted to a 2, after the second OM-d body I bought exhibited the same problems -- see updated below).<br /><br />Update - August 2012: I got a second OM-d...this time with the 14-42mm lens. I wanted to see if the problem was just a quality issue applicable to my first OM-d.  Unfortunately, the second OM-d had the same autofocus issues as the first.  I call it autofocus issues, but frankly it could be the Image Stabilization (IBIS), the shutter, or some other problem that causes notto be as sharp as they should be.  But the bottom line is that the camera, in certain situations (not all) will not take pictures as sharp as they should be.<br /><br />I tried dozens of pictures using Shutter Priority at 1/100th of a second and 1/400th of a second; Aperture Priority; Program Mode...the problem persisted in all modes.  Using the anti-shock setting seemed to help somewhat, but not totally.  This setting delays the firing of the shutter after the shutter button is pressed.  I compared it to shots taken with a Canon G1X and T2i.  The problem was isolated to the OM-d.  The other cameras did not exhibit this sharpness/autofocus issue.<br /><br />Some people reading my original review"

187019,2273808,"sample, the printer was located on a different level of the house, well removed from the router.  Also of interest to me, a comparison test of the same photo over WiFi to each of my other three Epson printers reflected effectively equal time standards to completion and output quality.<br /><br />Ink<br /><br />The XP-950 has 6 Claria cartridges (5 dye based color and 1 black) cartridges. In my opinion the dye based ink is far superior for purposes of production of color prints. The life of cartridges will be dependent upon print tendencies for any user but based on my experience with another Epson using the same dye base ink, it is not likely anything near the published output will be approached and it is also probable these cartridges are more susceptible to clogs as a result of dormancy than might be the case with other manufacturers like HP.<br /><br />My Bottomline<br /><br />The Epson XP-950 is an outstanding photo printer with just enough functionality to meet other personal printing needs. However if the objective is to procure a device that will function effectively as the primary printing resource for home or home office needs, there are other units within the Epson family that might be a better fit, including the XP-800 which has many of the same features/capabilities as XP-950 with additional components that might more closely correlate to typical business oriented needs.tional print options I have not attempted to date are o CD/DVD labeling, coloring book creation and personal stationery.<br /><br />With Epson Connect, essentially there are six alternative print applications available, some dependent on the device to be employed and in many respects overlapping for a specific device. Once an email address is established for the printer via Epson Connect it is feasible to initiate print functionality from remote locations from an email enabled device and it works well. Through Epson iPrint (downloadable app) or Airprint, printing and scanning is possible from Android or iOS devices. I have tested the utility from an iPhone and iPod Touch although I personally don't have a significant amount of need for it. Similarly, another utility I have no use for, files can be scanned to Google Cloud.<br /><br />Copy<br /><br />Up to 99 copies of any plain paper document can be initiated by placement of document on scanner glass or  from a inserted card or flash drive.

190104,3133875,"sample of Savanaah's Argan Face Cream, I was impressed with the natural ingredients.  According to the jar, it contains:  Organic Argan Oil (for smoothing, plumping, anti-oxidant effects) Organic Marigold/Callendula Extract (soothes burns, calms eczema, anti-oxidant), Plant-based Collagen (helps regenerate skin elasticity), Wheat Germ Oil (contains vitamin E, helps with scars and soothes irritation), Sesame Oil (anti-viral and anti-inflammatory), Cornflower Extract, and Vitamin C (helps reverse sun damage).  All these good things are combined in a rich, unscented and fast absorbing cream that left my face feeling super moisturized and soothed.<br /><br />I applied it before bed, after cleaning my face, and loved the way it made my skin feel plumped and hydrated.  I used it one night after I had gotten a little too much sun at the baseball field, and noticed it tingling a little bit.  The next morning my face looked normal - no sunburn left!

This is so good that by most standards it may be illegal.  It simply cannot be described; objectivity doesn't do it justice.  So good that one can become absorbed in the sound and hours simply melt away.  The mind becomes full of richness and purity that evokes an essence that is rarely found in the world.  All else fades away and only peace, or dissonance, as one wills, prevails.  Sound that transcends into the metaphysical.  Wonderful.      I realize that this only faintly addresses one aspect of a synthesizer; equally or more important is its ability to enable the creation of music.  If my brief experience is any guide, it seems to be well apt of the great review"

198568,1780655,"sample pic from another user with his car is typical at 800 ISO, unfortunately. But.. there are ways around it. I limit photos in decent lighting to ISO 400, since more than that invites extra noise. I also tend to frame the shot when I shoot it, and don't crop much. That is important, because if you want to crop, you will see noise unless you are outside in very good light. Then again, this is a compact camera, I don't expect miracleseither. What may matter to you too: It's not an easy camera to master. It has many options, some more meaningful than others. Coming from a DSLR, I learned to \\""eyeball\\"" the exposure of a scene and that has proved very useful with the F300, since the automatic is not as smart as it should be. If you know how to tweak a camera, you'll get a lot more out of this camera. Luckily exposure is easy to adjust and unlike the F11 it has a true manual mode. If you only rely on fully-automatic settings, then at least limit it to ISO 400 or 800 and then just start shooting and you should be all right too.    As for me, I went through the gamut-- I wanted to return it after one day (one star), but decided to test it more thoroughly and am really appreciating it now.

Then we tried this Just 6 Limited Ingredient Recipe.  With just six ingredients, I would have thought that it would have the most protein of all the foods, but it actually has the least:  Chef Michael's Chicken has 28%, Rachel Rays Nutrish Chicken has 26%, Hills i/d has 22% and this Just 6 has 20%.  It is made of Lamb, rice, beets, poultry fat and chicken \\""flavor\\"".  Serving size is about the same for all four foods.<br /><br />I think this food is formulated for dogs that have temperamental digestive systems that function best with a limited amount of ingredients.  Some dogs need to avoid corn, wheat and soy.  Plus there are no artificial anythings in this food.<br /><br />We will finish off the rest of this bag of Just 6, but since our dog likes the chicken dog foods better, and since he is having no issues with the higher protein food, I think we will pass on this Just 6 in the future.  After all, with all the fresh veggies he eats, he surely doesn't need the 7% fiber that this food provides.<br /><br />We've only been testing"

214553,2296354,"sample compelling, vivid, ground-breaking fantasy films of their era's that can't help but make a lasting impression on the developing mind.     `Labyrinth' (10/10)...     Despite having aged the least well (e.g. `80's hair-do's, synthesised music etc) it's easily the most atmospheric and absorbing of the three films. Memorable puppets, original music, grotesque creatures, hilarious characters, an absorbing quest...all combine to create pure magic.     `Dark Crystal' (7/10)...     With eerily excellent puppeteeing throughout and pitch-perfect voice performances this oddity of a film is an enjoyable, if frightening mix of classic fantasy themes with modern special effects (of their time). But it just doesn't deliver huge amounts of compelling story, the story is clever, definitely, but somehow difficult to engage with, perhaps due to the lack of human protagonists. But it's still an absorbing movie.     `Mirrormask' (8/10)...     There are some absolutely glowing review"

216041,1228704,"sample right at the beginning of the book and it took all the way until 40% (Kindle speak) into the book to get the results back. In the meantime the story didn't progress much. Lots of character building and soap-drama but as for the missing girl nothing much happened. What I came to realize was that this book was very realistic to real-life police work. Lots of waiting, missing clues and dead ends. Usually detective stories are not too realistic because the reader wants some of the reality suspended so the story moves along faster. J. Mark Bertrand took another avenue which in my opinion really paid off. The story ended up being very real and quite gripping. I couldn't have been more impressed. The writing was very good and flowed naturally.<br /><br /> The book would have been given four stars except for one event in the book that boosted it up to the \\""Life Changing\\"" five stars rating. My plans are to continue with the series. I highly recommend the book.<br /><br />1 Star = Pathetic<br />2 Stars = Fair<br />3 Stars = Good<br />4 Stars = Excellent<br />5 Stars = Life changing<br /><br />For those who give me a negative vote on my review"

There's a little romance and some sex, but mostly just the crazy antics of Elsie (Promo Girl) and her friends.  I absolutely loved Elsie, she was so refreshingly honest and upfront about everything.  I'm so tired of books about round-heeled, whiny, &#34;Woe is me&#34; women, who do nothing but get drunk and party but cry if anyone looks at them hard!!  The books are so descriptive, I felt as though I were watching a movie (in fact it could make a great comedy).  I had a couple of nitpicks, but not enough to bring my rating down.  Highly recommended for those who like well-written, funny books.  Review"

Should we have to do it that way? No. The directions should be clear and concise but they aren't and that's not a deal breaker for me. Maybe it is for you and if so then you need to know ahead of time that they really aren't, in fact there pretty much aren't any.

230474,64126,"sample tubes (which they continue to send you whenever you order) are only good for about two shaves.  But that was enough to convince me.<br /><br />And when you start using it, you'll see that the price isn't as bad as it appears at first.  They recommend you use two to three drops per shave.  I use three.  Plus, the once or twice a year when I get the urge to shave my head, I'll use three for my head as well.  That's truly all I need.  So I get just about the year they promise out of one bottle.  Now when you figure what you would spend on traditional shaving cream during that year, this really is very economical.<br /><br />The downside, at least for me, is the times I can't shave in the shower or surrounded by steam.  This stuff really works best with lots of moisture.  When I don't have it, I don't get the lubrication I need.  So if you can't or don't like to shave in the shower, this won't help you.<br /><br />But I know it does something.  I tried out of curiosity to see what shaving in the shower without this stuff would feel like.  It wasn't a pretty picture.<br /><br />If you've found a shaving routine that works well for you, great.  Stick with it.  But if you are still trying to find a smooth comfortable shave, check out Total Shaving Solution.ttle shaving with shaving cream, and I liked having a visual guide to where I had and hadn't shaved.  But I have found that if you actually focus on what you are doing as you shave, you get everything.  And this has an added bonus.  I can shave around my goatee and sideburns without shaving too much or not enough thanks to shaving cream hiding the edges.<br /><br />For what you get, this stuff is pricey.  A 1.25 oz bottle costs $15.00 (plus 4.33 shipping since this is only available over the web).  Yeah, that's what I said at first, too.  But the site does offer free"

232638,3163175,"sample! I didn't particularly care for the designs they sent but I had a lot of fun with them. I think 'flash tattoos' is just a fancy way of saying 'metallic temporary tattoos' so if you're not up on the trend don't worry, they're easy to put on and easy to remove.<br /><br />What makes these really special is that with the metallic pieces you get the effect of wearing jewelry without actually having to put it on. If you have small wrists like I do you can easily take the chains and give yourself a bracelet and matching ring. I did find it a little difficult to line up the ends around my wrist so you might want to ask a friend to give you a hand any time you're going for that effect. I also found that any that overlap knuckles will tear within seconds of drying so if you're trying to put them on your hands like you see in the packaging photos or as you see in my photos you may want to dry something different.<br /><br />Overall, I would only rate these a 4 star rating because I was disappointed with how quickly they got dull. The clear parts turned gray in less than 24 hours and the black ones cracked and faded within 48. Some tips I recommend are avoiding hand sanitizer and other alcohol based products being used near them, but also anything with oils like lotions and potentially even hand soaps. Which brings me to a final recommendation: save these for a special occasion! They're very cool but don't stay pretty for long when you're required to wash your hands a lot or will potentially have clothing rub against them.<br /><br />Notes: I received a complimentary product in exchange for this review"

245236,266794,"sample, I enthusiastically accepted once I saw that their product is made from birch trees rather than corn.<br /><br />Xylitol is a sugar alcohol that is metabolized more slowly than sugar. It is lower calorie than sugar - but not no-calorie. It has 2.4 calories per gram vs. 3.87 calories per gram of sugar. Since there are 4 grams in a teaspoon, there are slightly less than 10 calories per teaspoon of xylitol and you generally substitute 1:1 with sugar.<br /><br />Xylitol has a surprising number of health benefits! Large dental studies have shown that people who take at least 6 grams of xylitol per day have a greatly reduced incidence of dental caries. Its use also greatly reduces the incidence of otitis media (ear infections) in children. Of course, it can be helpful as a sweetener in diabetic diets because it has a much lower glycemic index (7) than white sugar (85-100).<br /><br />My only cautions are a) xylitol is highly toxic to dogs so you must be very careful not to allow your pets to ingest any and b) large amounts of xylitol can cause loose stools initially so start out slowly.<br /><br />So with so many brands of xylitol available, why choose Morning Pep? Well, IMO, xylitol made from birch is superior to xylitol made from corn (which could be GMO), even though it is more expensive to produce. I also like that it is made in the USA.<br /><br />Morning Pep tastes great and dissolves well and even though it's much more expensive than white sugar, it's waaay less expensive than dental work. I'm sold.<br /><br />NOTE: I was provided a free"

253973,3278243,"sample this set of resistance bands, which has honestly been a great thing.<br /><br />Now, these are not the first resistance bands I have tried. I currently have another good set I am working on and feel pleased with so far, but something both my wife and I like about these is the way this setup is structured. Unlike many other sets, these have pretty good instructions, different resistance levels (between 2 or so pounds to 30 or so), and multiple ways to use them. The set has five bands in it with metal connectors, each with its own color. There is:<br />+ a yellow, very light resistance band<br />+ a green, light resistance band<br />+ a red, medium resistance band<br />+ a blue, heavy resistance band<br />+ a  black, super heavy resistance band<br /><br />You can use these in different ways depending on preference and what you want to accomplish, from foam handles, ankle straps, or even securing them to a door, and you can choose the resistance you want to mirror your goals. I have been trying to build a bit of muscle while my wife has been toning and losing weight, so we can mix-and-match bands, using different levels together to fine-tune what we want, and we compete with one another for extra motivation. I like the band setup because you can combine bands, and doing so allows you to well exceed the 30 pounds or so of resistance as well, getting you resistance weights of over 70 pounds. The metal clips on the bands are placed well, too, so you do end up with them rubbing or creating an obstacle you need to work around, and they appear very sturdy even with the higher weight thresholds.<br /><br />I also like that I can take this with me anywhere and not have to worry about anything. That was always a problem with a gym; even if the same type you belong to is available while travelling, you still have to find transportation, work it into your schedule, and more. This way, you reduce stress while adding a more optimal way to travel.<br /><br />As noted before, these were provided as a sample or at a reduced cost for sampling purposes. I buy based on suggestions and take any recommendation seriously, so sampling does not impact review"

Plus it is a boon for women that a plus 60 actress got to play this role.  Martin is really in a very small role here.  His funniest moment is when he listening to a divorce self help tape in his car and then we find out he's been divorced over 3 years!  He really plays a nerd most of the time though, a very nice nerd but certainly not the hilarious guy we know he can be, or the deadly serious one either.  As a comedy duo, Baldwin and Streep remind me a bit of Fey and Baldwin on 30 Rock.  They are a good comedic duo and I wouldn't mind seeing them make another movie, sort of like Doris & Rock.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

On those days the other CB Easy Ovulation tester was negative, and its test sticks only showed single line. From what I have heard this is normal because the &#34;Advanced&#34; checks for rising estrogen levels, which the regular tester does not. On the third day, the CBE Advance gave me &#34;peak&#34; reading, solid smiley (luteinizing hormone detected) and it coincided with my other CB test also giving me a positive (smiley, luteinizing hormone detected). Both test sticks had clearly defined second lines.<br /><br />The readings on both were accurate for when I usually ovulate, as I have charted my days on a calendar many months prior. I have become pregnant in the past using the old version, CB Easy Ovulation tester (not this advance one, as it was not available at the time).<br /><br />HOWEVER...I went to test again today and my CB regular tester gave me another smiley, positive for ovulation (which is normal, as sometimes I have ovulated for one day, sometimes 2), BUT when I went to use the CB Easy Advance, I noticed that the smiley from the day prior was STILL DISPLAYED. It was FROZEN! I tried to insert a stick to see if it would reset, but had no luck. I only used about 7-8 sticks out of 20 before this CB Easy Advance FROZE on me in a perpetual state of smiley face.

I worked with many former HR Block customers who were so delighted with the Turbo Tax software, and the customer support, and the low price.

Like a child I sat there running my finger up and down the slide switch to `test and try' all 7 settings. As I hit each one, I was in awe. This is just a touch lamp I was telling myself, but yet something that has provided me comfort for so many years and my other lamp was only a 3 way lamp, regular bulbs. Upgrading to the 7 switch/slide and an LED, it is truly amazing! I have it set up where I can just move my arm, touch the left side to hit the first button which turns it on. Each setting obviously gets brighter but yet it is not blinding, it has a very comforting shade to it. I had both lamps plugged in and the LED just looks more inviting. I am able to adjust the light before getting into bed, such as do I want it turned away from the bed at a higher brightness or do I want to have it face me at the lowest setting.

267053,2521231,"sample) I began to fear the worst....as in quick order the \\""book\\"" Jesse/Paradise, was slightly skewed so that it resembled more the \\""tv\\"" Jesse/Paradise.  The slight changes (no big spoilers here as this is in the first few pages) include Jesse moving from his apartment to a rental house on an inlet across from a bridge, his romance with Parker's other character, Sunny Randall, is on ice as she is now working long term on a case in England.  A slight change that is difficult to miss, is that the writing style is vastly different, and this is both bad and good.  The negative is that it does not have the same \\""feel\\"" of the shorter chapters that end with some sort of one liner.  The positive is that the author pays more attention to the story...let me rephrase that, stories - as there are multiple plot lines that kept me engaged.<br /><br />Once I got past the differences and recognized that there were not to be any more and any vast changes I began to enjoy the book, and again there was much in the plot to enjoy.  A released criminal from L.A. is out for revenge and causing havok in Paradise.  There is a school hostage sitation and the fall out from that, and a mob element that is muscling in, using Paradise as its home.  In a Parker novel, one of these might be the only plot, so I found the book rich and engaging with much to keep the story moving forward.<br /><br />Having said that, there were some significant alterations that might bother some more than it did for me, though it was nice to finally get away from some of these..(Minor Spoilers this paragraph)....Jesse no longer has a dog, but a cat adopts him, which seems very un Jesse-like.  In addition his wife, Jenn, is hardly mentioned, and makes zero appearance in this book...not even a phone call, so that hang up seems to be over, which while out of character for these books does serve as a relief to those of us readers who were tiring of that never ending loop.  Finally, Jesse's drinking is no longer a problem.  He has a scotch or beer occassionally in the book, but there is no wrestling over how many, etc. - they just seemed to take the \\""issue\\"" away so he no longer has a problem (though the problem did exhist because his past treatment of a criminal is part of this book's plot).<br /><br />I was surprised by the end at how much I enjoyed this book.

While I agree that having a lower brightness helps to match prints, in the real world, people who don't make prints are going to be using these and they are set to 120 cd/m^2 brightness, which is too little IMO. The 160 cd/m^2 is a better option, or just tell people to set their own brightness and then instruct the program to use the native luminance. They will not significantly impact prints, at least consumer printing places which take these things into account.<br /><br />The colorimeter's Flare Correct can try to correct for glare on the screen and it's a cool feature. It's not selected by default, and the software doesn't make a recommendation one way, but the X-Rite's support page says, &#34;Consider enabling this option if there is a large amount of glare on the surface of the display when the display is powered off while seated in a normal position relative to the display.&#34; and &#34;Typically, Flare Correct will improve the accuracy of the display profile.&#34; I usually use my computer in darkened room, but it said it would improve the accuracy of the display profile, so I ran it anyways, thinking that it would just get a value which would be ignored. The results I got with it were strange. It had me adjust the brightness level to 54, which is quite low, and the resulting profile had whites that didn't resonate ANY kind of whiteness... 255,255,255 isn't supposed to look dull, and that's what it looked like. I ran another calibration (D65/native brightness/native contrast/adjust controls manually) without Flare Correction, and this time it didn't have me adjust brightness at all, it left it at the setting (70) that was selected at the beginning. For some reason, with Flare Control on, it was having me set my level to 150, though it looked worse than that. They need clarity on this issue - my advice is to leave it off unless you actually have glare, or it will lead to poor results.<br /><br />I don't know if it was the software's fault, but when I first installed and started using it, my results were literally inconsistent, even though I wasn't making huge changes in the profiling setup. I wasn't sure if I got a lemon or it was just the freaking software and it's undocumented issues. I was considering returning it and getting a Spyder5 instead. They have updated the software twice since I've had it, and in the latest update (1.6.3), they specifically said mention that there are improvements to the algorithm and such. Like the rest of their mess of communication though, you can only see the documented changelog in the installer. The website only says that they fixed bugs from a previous version.<br /><br />I ~did~ get my rebate from Rapid Rebates money too! It took the full 10 weeks, but it arrived.

278654,871606,"sample.  After having used my IdeaPad for almost two weeks, I think it has the best keyboard of any laptop I've used.  I am also delighted that the trackpad is positioned such that I don't have any stray hits on it while using the spacebar.  This has been a real downer on other machines I've had.  The keys on the keyboard are on the firm side, but I got used to this after a couple of hours.  Now I prefer it over the loose, chicklet style keyboard on my HP.<br /><br />Entertainment:  The sticker next to the trackpad asks, \\""What's your idea of Fun?\\""  Mine includes two main categories: music and movies.  The SRS enhanced sound plays into both of these.  In the \\""Sound Manager\\"" utility you have the option to switch between three modes: normal, music, and movie.  I skip normal and use music unless I am watching a movie.  This setting seems to be better suited for dialog.  In either case the built in speakers acquit themselves quite well when compared to the afterthoughts installed on most laptops/netbooks.  I also found that my music sounded crisp and detailed when I plugged in my JBuds J4 earbuds.  For movies I found that streaming HD from both Amazon Instant Video and Netflix was flawless.  While I would like a higher resolution display (the Z570 maxes at 1366 x 768), the picture was crisp and had no lag or stutter.  The 6 GB of RAM ensure that you have enough horsepower for multimedia enjoyment.<br /><br />General Usability:  While the Z570 is easier to tote around than a desktop and monitor, it is a far cry from the myriad of touchscreen tablets that many people carry these days.  What you don't get with these, however, is 500 GB of storage, a generous display, and a full keyboard.  Is this worth almost *six* pounds?  That answer will varygreatly from one user to another.  In addition, I do find that I accidentally open the DVD-ROM player from time to time if I need to lift my IdeaPad up on the right side.  It's a minor annoyance.  Overall, though I find that the Z570 is very responsive and it has no problem running apps in parallel.  I do not play games; therefore, I can't comment on its suitability for that purpose.  However for general use (Office, Internet, E-mail, Music, Movies, etc.), it has more than enough horsepower.<br /><br />Lenovo Extras:  These could be argued as bloatware, but I would make the case that the ones that I've used are actually useful.  By far the coolest is the VeriFace login utility.  When you fire it up for the first time, it uses the onboard webcam to take a picture of your face and associate it with the account you have logged in with.  Then it automatically launches anytime the login screen comes up.  It works pretty smoothly as long as you have sufficient light for the camera to get a good image.  It seems to zero in on the right eye/side of the face for its recognition.  I also use the Power Management Options utility.  This lets you choose a battery usage profile that will ensure that you charge optimally.  I always have my IdeaPad plugged in, and with this profile it only charges the battery to 50% in order to maximize battery life.  You can also choose schemes that balance performance with energy consumption.  I think it is pretty well done.  In addition, I think the YouCam software is pretty good.  The features compare favorably with the software that Logitech provides for its USB webcams.  I'm not a big webcam user, but there are plenty of effects you can use to amuse yourself.  It also has integration with YouTube, Facebook, and e-mail.  It's pretty nice if webcams are your thing.  The final thing I have used is the Boot Optimizer.  I ran this after it took over a minute for my IdeaPad to boot up (the tool reports this every time you login unless you turn it off).  After I ran the optimizer, boot up is about 40 seconds.<br /><br />Overall:  The Lenovo IdeaPad Z570 is a good choice for balanced use between productivity and entertainment.  If you have questions that I have not addressed, please feel free"

This means the aftermarket 64GB card I installed will have greater capacity to record (at or near 16 hours) than I have to drive in a day...<br /><br />-Streamlined user interface. The camera has just two physical control points. One is the DC power adapter (which can be connected or disconnected at either the camera or the vehicle's 12v socket). The other is the camera's manual \\""event\\"" button. You can use this to manually select a the following minute as an \\""Event\\""; this protects that minute from being automatically overwritten if the SD card reaches full capacity (and flags is with a exclamation point in the Road Hawk software video file listing). All other settings are made via the Road Hawk software on a computer and stored as a .txt configuration file on the card. Two LEDs face the driver; a red one for camera operation and a green one for GPS signal acquisition.<br /><br />-Flexible recording options: in addition to manually designating \\""event\\"" times, they can be automatically triggered via the camera's G force settings. The sensitivity settings are also adjustable via the Road Hawk software. You can also adjust the default recording times (1 minute blocks are the default; these can be incrementally adjusted up to 30 minutes in length). You can also disable the reservation of space (25% of SD card capacity) for events, and use the entire card for \\""normal\\"" recording.<br /><br />-Outstanding software. The DC-2 install CD contains two program. One is the Road Hawk software, which integrates video, GPS, G-force, time, date and Google maps data for a comprehensive recap of vehicle activity. Also included is a trial/limited feature version of RaceRender (fixed product logos and limited customization), which can overlay additional data (including other vehicular sensors, if available) and then export these to several video formats. It will recognize the GPS data the DC-2 embeds in the video (.mp4) and offer to integrate into the project. When it does, it will leave behind a separate .txt file with the geo data in the folder with the source .mp4 file.<br /><br />-Superb user guide. This is a rarity in electronics these days. The DC-2's user guide is detailed and well-written. This is the quality of user documentation that we should expect with everything that plugs in (be sure to view the two instructional videos included on the software install CD).<br /><br />So, is the DC-2 perfect? Not totally. I encountered some things that could stand attention. Overall, please these are very minor when considered with the tightly integrated functions the total hardware/software package offers users.<br /><br />-Hardware:<br />--I'm not crazy about the adhesive-to-windshield mount. I would have preferred an option to mount this on a weighted (friction/beanbag) mount (and I probably could improvise one with a creative application of velcro and/or duct tape. Interestingly, the DC-2 has a standard tripod mount. However, it is inexplicably (to me) located on the top of the camera. While I might have preferred a bottom location for the tripod mount, I am successfully an aftermarket suction cup mount (the Arkon Camera Car Mount on the windshield, which allows use of the the female tripod mount on the top of the camera. While I have an additional bias against suction cup windshield mounts also, I prefer that option to the adhesive type. A Road Hawk-specific suction cup mount is available (as an option under the same listing as the camera).<br />-While I appreciate the simple on camera interface, a physical audio record enable/disable switch on the camera would be a huge step up. You can configure this via the software, but it's not changeable until you return the SD card to your PC and adjust the settings.<br /><br />-Software:<br />--the Road Hawk software window is not resizable. If you select the full screen option when viewing video, the associated sensor, GPS, Google maps and video file information becomes unavailable. Too bad.<br />--You'll also need to know your GMT offset to properly set the time (which is then calculated to local from the GPS data); it's unclear whether this will self-adjust at the end of daylight savings time. If not, those west of Greenwich will have to increase their offset by one hour. This isn't rocket science, but is a possible area of confusion for those not used to dealing with GMT (and the changes that occur as a result of local daylight savings changes).<br />--The Road Hawk software always defaults to the program's installation folder when you want navigate to source videos. This would be much improved as a user option to specify a default folder for it to begin navigating for source videos (or, as some programs do, persistence in remembering where you got your most recent video). This is true even if you have set your Windows options to include the Road Hawk executable to appear in a context menu as an application associated with video types. Note: the companion RaceRender program will accept video input directly from a context menu option.<br />-The RaceRender software is both powerful, and feature-dense. Users who like to explore software functions will have fun. Those who seek a more direct user experience should prepare from a learning curve.<br /><br />-These are *very* minor points in an otherwise totally outstanding partnership between capable hardware, high performing software and excellent user guide.<br /><br />Overall, the DC-2 offers one of the very best user experiences I have ever encountered in a piece of consumer electronics.<br /><br />I was provided the DC-2 for review"

It's great for getting off little things that may be stuck on your kitchen floor (especially around the garbage can area where food sometimes falls).

284290,1494389,"sample and I read it and was so impressed that I immediately got the book. The more I progressed through the novel, the more impressive it became and while I will explain some of the reasons later, I will say that Dancing with Eternity turned out to be the first mind blowing 2011 sff novel I did not previously know about.  OVERVIEW/ANALYSIS: Dancing with Eternity stands out in three areas: world building which includes both natural philosophy and strange societies, voice and characters.  It is the 40th century and Mo aka Mohandas born on Mars in the 22nd century and named for the famous 20th century Indian leader, has been a lucky man. Born on the cusp of the great revolutions that transformed humanity for ever - the understanding of mind which led to the \\""net of human minds\\"" and then to effective immortality and ftl by harnessing the power of minds traveling near light speed - he became a relatively famous architect, wealthy enough to afford the very expensive immortality treatments and weather the three centuries of turmoil when humanity adapted to this radical change.  Led by the amoral but efficient multinational corporations known today as \\""syndicates\\"", the human race's ruthless expansion into the universe created enough wealth to afford everyone's \\""rebooting\\"" - as the immortality treatments came to be known - at a price though. And Mo has not passed unscathed through the turmoil, so despite becoming even wealthier, from the stabilization of the 25th century on, he started drifting through life, exploring the ever expanding human reach, mostly as a musician or actor with occasional \\""domestic lifetimes\\"".  Two other major events disrupted the continual expansion: the brutal \\""gender war\\"" of the 30th century - the millennial anniversary of its cessation has been celebrated some five decades before the start of the novel and was partly the impulse motif of the book's plot - in which the worlds of the Pleiades tried to secede under the Yin radical feminist movement, expelling all males under the \\""new gender laws\\"" and creating their own \\""net\\"". The main human polity, now known as Draco from the humanity's expansion in that direction, responded with armed intervention and the ensuing war was terrible, finally ending in a truce under which the Pleiades remained politically independent but repelled the gender discrimination laws and reintegrated into the original \\""net\\"" - this last being crucial since the net's effectiveness depends on the number of minds logged on.  Even scarier was humanity's \\""first contact\\"" in the 35th century with a mysterious alien civilization on what is now named Brainard's Planet. Despite the best efforts of the expedition led by the aforementioned Brainard, humans could not initiate contact with the natives, but instead a mysterious \\""plague\\"" destroying all Earth originated lifeforms at cellular level - and with rebooting accelerating the destruction, the death is final unless the personality is stored on the net and the body cloned from earlier genetic material, happenings that are not computationally feasible on a large scale - started to spread with the return of the expedition to human space. Only the brutal quarantine of several planets and the ensuing billions of deaths spared humanity. Today Brainard's planet is under strict quarantine and orbital observation, though nobody is insane to go there anyway, while five hundred years of observations produced some startling results and even more mysteries...  So back to the late 40th century and Mo now an actor with a lizard-like scaly body form gets marooned on a resort planet 350 light years from Earth over a tax disputewith \\""the system\\"". Not only that but he is kicked off net and has to practice daily to keep up in shape, while providing \\""physical comfort\\"" to a local shopkeeper for shelter and food.  When a mysterious beautiful woman going by the nickname of Steel makes him an offer to pay his back taxes and take him to space in return for him completing her seven member starship crew and being able to go ftl again, Mo cannot refuse and the adventure starts - as mentioned ftl aka free"

The feeling I got from this film was, Woody Allen tried to make Hall Pass ([[ASIN:B004EPYZS0 Hall Pass]]), and failed miserably.<br /><br />The film opens beautifully, with a group of thirty something friends sitting around a dinner table talking. The banter is interesting, fun, and engaging. Annie and Darren appear to be a happy couple very much in love, entertaining their mostly single friends. The movie then moves on to Annie and Darren endlessly over analyzing everything. It becomes clear; these two people love each other deeply as intellectual friends that happen to share the same bed.

These discrepancies are partly due to relative simplicity of spoken language to written language.  Additionally, one may understand more words than one uses, meaning that one's working vocabulary may not be representative of one's total knowledge of a language.<br /><br />A 1987 research on native English speaking university graduates found an average vocabulary size of 17,200 base words.

Though he wants Malena just as badly as they do, Renato's passion for the woman is more pure than the others. He can see right through everyone else and wants to protect Malena from anyone taking advantage of her. How can he do it though? He's a small, thin boy who's trying to be a man. The kid tries his best though! For example, he wants to wear long pants like adult men instead of the shorts all the boys have to wear. What grown man didn't try that at some point when he was younger? When her husband is reported dead, the competition for Malena grows more fierce. Some men make up stories about being engaged to her, some offer her desirable goods (like sugar and bread) which are hard to come by with the country at war. While Malena's troubles grow, so do Renato's. He's driving his parents crazy whenever he's *ahem* alone in his room doing something that a squeaky bed givesaway. School isn't going any better either. He's head over heels for a woman that doesn't even know his name, always spying on her in his free"

Also, the offered price for these speakers is wildly variable both on Amazon and at Best Buy, so buyer beware, monitor the price for a few weeks before buying, or you will be weeping over the 33% extra you paid because you bought at the wrong moment!e Sony claims this combination can produce sounds of up to 45,000 hz, in other words about twice as high as the Athena's 20 Khz. Humans in general can't hear even as high as 20Khz, so Sony's point here is lost on me. I would have asked my dog what he thought, but he does not like either music or film. In any case, highs were produced nicely by the S3, but not any more nicely than by the Athena.<br /><br />Things got more interesting in bass and mids. The Athena's huge 8 inch woofer was less crisp and articulated in producing mids, especially when a strong bass signal was coming out at the same time. (This was most apparent in St Saens, when the organ and orchestra are playing at once, but was also seen in \\""Kind of Blue\\"" when piano and bass were playing.) The Sony's dual 5 inch woofer design gave a better more distinct sound to both mid and low frequencies.<br /><br />However, the S3s failed a bit in terms of playing low powerful bass. The 8 inch woofer on the Athena really shone in Massive Attack's \\""Mezzanine\\"" and hit the thumping deep notes intended in the recording. The S3 produced excellent objectively competent bass, but the 2 5 inches could not match the Athena 8 inch for sheer low extension or oomph. Size does matter in some things!<br /><br />What does all this mean? In a stereo only system, without a subwoofer, meant for playing music, the Athena is the best choice. (Or more precisely a modern day equivalent of the Athena, a two way floorstander with an 8 inch woofer.)<br /><br />However, for a more typical HT system, with a receiver driving 5 or 7 speakers plus a sub or two, the S3 is perfect. You don't really need deep bass from a front speaker in that layout, as you probably will be running all your speakers as \\""small\\"" in the system setup menu, meaning your sub(s) will be doing all the heavy lifting, and your fronts will be taking care of the upper bass and mids in that very common configuration (second in frequency only to the soul-crushingly dull \\""soundbar and sub\\""  or worse yet, \\""soundbar only\\"" configuration for HT systems). Friends don't let friend buy soundbars!<br /><br />Sad to say, the Athena's huge size and large woofer is more or less a dying breed in the modern audio world, and the multiple 5 inch woofer designs are more and more common. If you are using these as part of an HT system, you will be very pleased with the excellent sound and detailed mid range clarity of the S3. The S3 is a fine example of the floor standing HT front speaker breed, and although the massive treble proficiency boasted of seems a bit more theoretical than real in actual listening tests, I liked the sound capabilities of these a lot, and the fit and finish were typically high Sony quality.<br /><br />If this speaker did a bit better in low bass power, I would have been tempted to give it five stars, or if I had two of them set up and could really test and listen for that magical 45 Khz extension promised by the super tweeter, the S3 might also have gotten its fifth star. But as I heard it, a solid 4 stars is its rating, with a fifth star to be added for value f you get them for less than 2/3rds of list, which is possible depending on Amazon's mood du jour. (See below.)<br /><br />In ancillary matters, I did not appreciate the difficulty involved in testing"

My wife's only concern with the pump so far is that she'd bought a large amount of liquid soap just a few weeks before I got the pump, and she's wondering if she can use them together.  I don't think she can, or should; I think it's meant for more liquidy rather than creamy or viscous soaps.  Reading the product details, I did notice on Amazon that there are cucumber soaps, et al, that are made for the simplehuman Sensor Pump, but I don't think I'd stray from them into the big warehouse store soap bottles because I have a feeling they would soon kill the unit and never work properly when it is still alive.<br /><br />For $34.99, I think this is a good solid deal, and I'm happy with the unit we received.

I made a simple shot and was actually amazed by the differences - I wasn't expecting such a wide variation. Perhaps it's possible to fine tune some of these differences out, but I found the DeLonghi to be closest to my taste, with the Jura a close second. To me, the Saeco tasted a bit \\""burnt\\"" and was my least favorite. None were horrible, but the DeLonghi came closest to what I brew by hand. Based on this test, I eliminated the Saeco, although I would have liked to sample other Saeco models.      There are big differences in the milk handling between these units. The DeLonghi uses a self-contained milk carafe that simply snaps into the machine when you want a latte or cappuccino. It's easy, and it has the advantage that you can keep it filled and stored in the refrigerator whenever you like.

I tried each beverage - they were all good - but when I tasted Chai Latte I was totally Wowed(!!)...not being too dramatic here...this is now my favorite morning beverage. It's good for an afternoon pick-me-up too. The flavor is truly delicious.<br /><br />Chai Latte is a blend of savory, exotic spices and black tea, accompanied by milk and a blend of natural and artificial sweeteners. There are overtones of cinnamon, so if you like that spice, you will definitely enjoy this drink. A plus is that this chai is low in sugar. I know that some review"
324796,447025,"sample of what the audio sounds like compared to the GoPro in my video.<br /><br />★★ Software ★★<br />Software for Macs and PC's is pre-installed in the camera. That software is then written to the Micro SD card once you've inserted the card and turned the camera on and off. You should see two files at the root level... actionplus for Macs and actionplus.exe for PC's. This application allows to change all the settings and set the time and date of the camera. You can set the TV type to PAL or NTSC. You can adjust the Auto Power OFF time from OFF to 1 minutes or 3 minutes. You can turn Auto Rotation on or off and you can set the date & time.<br /><br />★★ WiFi ★★<br />The WiFi worked pretty well both on my laptop and on my iPhone5s. Essentially there are 2 modes of operation with WiFi. The first mode is to connect tothe cameras' actionplus adhoc network from a computer using a web browser (192.168.1.2). In this mode you can navigate and download the files on the memory card... you can change the SSID and password... you can update the camera firmware...you can view a live stream from the camera.<br /><br />The second WiFi mode is to connect to the Actionplus adhoc network from your SmartPhone. Connecting in this way using the \\""Winbook Action+ Remote\\"" app actually gives you significantly added useability, Using the app you can change photo resolution & mode, video resolution, view live streaming, check connection status and camera battery status.  You can also take photos or video using the SmartPhone app... it is then operating as a true remote for the camera operation.<br /><br />Concerning Live Streaming, Latency on my MacBook Pro was almost none but it was more significant on the iPhone. The latency on the iPhone is probably due to lack of processing power comapred to the laptop.<br /><br />★★ Mounting Hardware ★★<br />The included mounting hardware is extensive. Helmet mounts, board mounts, rollbar/handle bar mounts are included. Plus you get a 90 degree mount, a camera tilt mount and a quick-release mount. Many of them can be used together to get just the right camera orientation for the task at hand. You can even attach the camera to a backpack shoulder strap using the included hardware. Great for POV hiking or climbing videos.<br /><br />A USB charging/data cable is provided as is an HDMI cable.<br /><br />I think the video and photo quality of this camera is great. Hopefully my video will demonstrate this.<br /><br />Only negatives I can come up with at this point are these:<br /> - You can't operate the camera while it is being charged.<br /> - You cannot take a still shot while recording video<br /> - You cannot change camera settings on the camera directly except for switching between HD and FHD, otherwise you have to use the application or the smartphone app.<br /><br />When looking for the SmartPhone app, you should search for \\""Winbook Action+ Remote\\""<br /><br />Outstandingly good value for the price paid. I'm very happy with the performance of this MetroFlash E360 action camera.<br />It's got great battery life of 2.5 hours. It accepts memory cards up to 32 Gb (4 hours of video) and it's a convenient size.<br /><br />I was provided a free"

What I found most fascinating was the innovative design of the container—it’s plastic with a viewing window which means no more rust rings on the counter or running out of shave gel at the wrong moment!

333563,1888114,"sample size\\"" is too small to prove a trend. It is as faulty as the medical study arguing that since 12 people experienced pain relief by hoemopathy, that must mean that homeopathy will work for everyone. Horowitz and Laksin's methods simply leave too much room for cherry picking (how many universities did they NOT profile? Why? How many courses did they NOT scrutinize? Why?)     I am certainly not suggesting either that the trend of leftward \\""bully pulpit\\"" teaching does not happen. Several books have been written detailing the phenomenon quite well. And Horowitz and Laksin do a good job showing how absolutely irresponsible the courses they profile are (especially the ones pretending to be introductory survey couress that end up having non-representative reading lists and ideological agendas). If college professors are to be placed in positions of responsibility in order that they can teach young people how to think, then the professors profiled in this book should be put on notice that they are not living up to this ideal.    So, while I like the points that this book raises and think that the authors addres real concerns, I think that their \\""laundry list\\"" style makes their case very weak and open to accusations of cherry picking data. (It also gets repititious as many of these universities' courses are very similar, so reading each course profile becomes redundant.)     I would suggest that the interested reader first read Stanley Fish's \\""Save the World on Your Own Time.\\"" Fish's book is a very non-ideological evaluation"

As I paged through the book and I attempted to make mental notes about how the author would turn a phrase I couldn't keep up. The entire book is spent playing with words but it never gets pretentious or hollow.  It's simply a fun read.  Just to quote a short sample of Stone's lexicon mischievousness I'll quote the first night our main character, Colossus Sosloss, spends in the park as a tramp - he says \\""I wait for sleep to run me over and put me in the boot of its black car and drive me into tomorrow.\\""<br /><br />The mind numbing cast of characters that are introduced only make us wish that we could spend an hour or two rambling around the authors mind to see what sort of pharmaceuticals his brain is producing.

336436,1926362,"sample, and was very impressed. I ordered the full book.<br /><br />All I can say is wow. This book does an excellent job of explaining tongues and the Baptism of the Holy Spirit.  He explains it in a way that is easy to understand and acknowledges that tongues are often abused today. I  always thought there was just one type of tongues, but Roberson argues there are 3 Tongues for personal edification (also called a private prayer language) Tongues in a church service, and tongues for intercession. Roberson explains all 3 very well and uses Scripture to support each of them. Reading this book made me realize that I had made a lot of false assumptions about speaking on tongues. This book helped me to put my fears to rest and to see the whole issue from a new perspective.  I became very hungry for the Baptism in the Holy Spirit. Not every Christian has the spiritual gift of speaking in tongues, but Roberson says (and I came to agree) that every Christian can have a prayer language if they so desire. Before reading this book, I didn't even really know what it mean to have a personal prayer language, much less the benefits. One of my biggest fears in regards to tongue was that it would make me weird, that I would begin to pray in tongues at inappropriate tongues, or that I would no longer be able to pray in English. But Roberson makes it clear that NONE of that is true. Each person can choose to pray in tongues (otherwise known as a private prayer language) or not to. The Holy Spirit gives you the words, but it is up to the individual to speak them. The Holy Spirit won't bypass your free"

So, that is a plus from me to the Stuhrling Original watch.<br /><br />As for the Krysterna Crystal, I did two tests...<br /><br />I dropped a quarter from about a foot high on the crystal to see if it would shatter, scratch and it held up quite well with no scratch.  Dropped a marble on it...no shattering.  Granted, I didn't drop this on the cement which can damage any tough watch nor did I put it under a tire and back up but with these two tests, it did manage to not have any scratches and no shattering or cracks.<br /><br />And third, because of the China movement, I know people who buy Chinese watches (because they are cheap) but there are some very good movements from China such as Seagull.  I've read from one source that Stuhrling uses Seagull and Shanghai movements.  Granted, things may be ebauche (using Chinese parts) but because I know there are people who love Seagull and Shanghai movements, because this uses an ST-90050, it uses a Liaocheng Standard movement distributed by PTS Resources in Hong Kong.<br /><br />But it works great right now but like all watches, you need to give it standard use 3-months, 6-months a year to give a thorough analysis of the movement and how accurate the time will be.

What it comes with it, of course, is a double side filter (one side is a HEPA filter) and the other side looks like a hard foam filter, the pre-filter is also a foam one. These, I can attest do work nicely to purify a small office and adjacent storage room's air. I've spent a few hours working in the storage room, organizing computer components and other office materials, usually I use a dust mask, because regardless of how often I clean it, there is always dusk in this room. I placed the Frigidaire Air Purifier in it, on a table next to where I sat sorting out stuff, and I set it to medium speed. I was able to work without needing the dust mask and I didn't sneeze or get congested, which happens if I breath any dust.<br /><br />I like its size (it's lightweight and it can be moved from room to room if necessary). I think that it's a plus the fact that it only uses 5 Watts of power, and it does move a good amount of air, and the air that it comes out of it, it's fresh. It can perform as a desk fan in summer, but it doesn't make too much noise, even in a high setting, so it can be placed in a bedroom at night time. The LED light in the power/control button might be an issue in a bedroom, but that can be solved by placing some duct tape on it. The filters should be replaced every three months to a year, depending of use. The pre-filter can be washed and the main filter can be vacuumed.

350558,2337726,"sample of the Derma E Hyaluronic cream and had really never heard of hyaluronic acid, although I had heard of a village in Japan where people live for an especially long time. So, I was using this cream on a daily basis and after about a week, I took a second look in the mirror and my skin was literally \\""plumper\\"" as if it was more hydrated and healthy. About a week later, an article about hyaluronic acid appeared (as articles often do when looking for answers).<br /><br />Derma-E has a few products that are ahead of their time. My esthetician had not even heard of pycnogenol and I'm pretty sure that this product is also going to be new to her. These amazing discoveries seem to take years and years to filter down through our society and the fact that the product works so well, should mean everyone in the skin care industry is talking about it. Fortunately Derma-E is producing wonderful antiaging products that have dramatic results in a short amount of time.<br /><br />Apparently this \\""HA\\"" is also now available as a dietary supplement. The people in Japan who eat a sticky gelatinous root vegetable instead of rice have smooth skin, flexible joints and full heads of hair even when they are quite old. Researchers have finally concluded that they have unusually high levels of hyaluronic acid in their bodies.<br /><br />So what will this cream do for you? Well, since it seems to plump up the skin a bit in a noticeable way, you will want to use this cream in areas where you want to visibly reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Your skin will take on a smoother appearance and you might also find yourself hunting down the Pycnogenol and Hyaluronic Acid Eye Cr&egrave;me.<br /><br />It has taken me years to finally find products that promise and deliver and Derma E is a line of natural skin care products that visibly change your appearance in a matter of weeks. They have obtained licensees to use proprietary ingredients and they also believe in adding antioxidants to their products.<br /><br />Since these products are difficult to find in the stores, thankfully Amazon sells them and there are so many products to try. The Papaya Cleanser and Vanilla Bean Revitalizing Toner looks just delicious.<br /><br />Products I've tried and loved:<br /><br />Microdermabrasion Scrub - Salon Quality exfoliation right in your own home!<br />Astazanthin and Pycnogenol Age-Defying Moisturizing Cr&egrave;me<br />Cracked Skin Relief Cr&egrave;me<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"

There are also some pretty incredible people - one of which is names Ozzy. He seems to be everything she hates about the Program, but she can't seem to stay away from him either. He's too perfect and she can't get him off her mind.

354661,1180637,"sample page from my MacBook Pro over the network took about 15 seconds from pressing the print button to the sheet popping out. For someone used to the office laser printer taking a couple minutes to warm up, that's just fantastic.  Be sure to use proper laser paper with this device, at first my wife and I had been using the flimsy ink jet paper from our old printer, but that had a tendency to bring along extra blank pages. Sturdier paper designed for laser not only eliminates this problem, but feels great in the hand and looks great.<br /><br />The built in scanner does a serviceable job, either doing color scans for my computers over the network--I use my Mac's built in Scanner Utility, or Picasa on my wife's Windows 7 PC--or directly making greyscale copies at high resolution. I don't have a chance to try out the FAX feature, as I don't have a home phone line. A 300 DPI black and white scan took 14 seconds over my Gigabit network switch which is pretty good.<br /><br />In general, I disagree with the need for the Wi-Fi model. Stationary, desk bound devices should be connected via Ethernet barring an unusual circumstance. Wi-Fi can be finicky, something rarely true of Ethernet. I have green gigabit Ethernet switches in several locations in my home, and they have been reliable and left Wi-Fi bandwidth for mobile devices.<br /><br />As for the bad, I wasn't able to automatically connect to the printer from my Linux (Ubuntu) server as it couldn't find a proper driver. It doesn't support AirPrint for use with iOS devices. Oh for the day when being a laser printer meant having a Postscript interpreter, but alas, this just supports PCL6 and Samsung's own SPL, so much for hand coding my own EPS.<br /><br />[Update: A commenter pointed out the availability of the Samsung Mobile Print App in the Apple App Store. This can print and scan from this printer easily. I was able to print a Google Docs document, and a web page, and there are a variety of of other document sources such as the photo library, camera, clipboard, etc. I did experience a low memory warning after a few minutes of trying it out, so there are bugs. Still seems a good added benefit, although AirPrint support would be better.]<br /><br />[Another Update: At some point, when I upgraded OS X I stopped being able to setup this printer. An article on Samsung's website recommended resetting the printing system (option clicking on the list of printers) and that worked.]<br /><br />In general, I'm happy to now have a laser printer in the house. My wife's home business generates a lot of paper, and ink jet cartridge costs were adding up. At 2500 sheets per toner cartridge, our cost per page just plummeted. I've looked many times in the past at buying a laser printer, but either the user review"

I don't have to \\""choose\\"" which book will go on the road with me--I can take them all.  We've also discovered that my husband and I can now read the same book--without waiting for the other to finish.  However, I never expected the K2 to save me money!  It was an indulgence, and I read more now than before.  However, I didn't usually buy hardcover bestsellers because they were too expensive.  Now, I can read whatever is hot for $9.99.  Also, when I see something I'm interested in, I can download a sample and put it in the \\""virtual\\"" pile.  In the long run, this is saving me money.  I love to go to the bookstore, as much as reading--and would buy books, even when I was reading something else.  The pile next to the couch would grow, until hubby started stealing them and then would loan them out!  (I still sneak my kindle into the book store............)<br /><br />I don't need the backlight everyone seems to want--my books didn't have one!

388271,987582,"sample pack – pro and con:  Brooklyn Cocoa – has a very clean, simple ‘like a milk chocolate bar’ flavor – rich and not excessively sweet.  Junior Mints – the first of the popular candy flavors I tried didn’t quite emulate its namesake in liquid form. The mint is (kinda) there but the chocolate ‘coating’ flavor is more convincing.  Midnight was the dud of the bunch for me. Very undistinguished taste that was the most similar to the ‘Big Cocoa’ brands and their low-fat variants - which I especially dislike.  Charleston Chew Chocolatey Nougat – another subtle one. I know the candy well and, if you savor the cocoa, it really does take on the candy flavor. But if you’re looking for a bold burst, you’ll likely be disappointed.  Milk Chocolate was very close to Brooklyn, the first one I tried. Good and neither too sweet or ‘waxy’-tasting.  Campfire – Creamier and richer than some of the others but also sweeter. I don’t mind sweet if it doesn’t obscure the chocolate body, which this one came close to doing.  Tootsie Roll – Another bummer, flat and indistinct. Ironically, Campfire tasted more like Tootsie Roll than this one did(?)  Sugar Babies – Love the candy, the cocoa has a similar ‘waxy’ (in a good way) flavor and is almost as sweet. This one came closest among the candy emulations.  Peanut Butter Cup – Didn’t work for me. In fact the only flavor I wouldn’t try again (and I love the real thing).  Carnival – another vague, generic not-bad flavor that lacks real character.  Mexican – Nice rich and clean taste. Not especially spicy, so I don’t really get the connection, but I enjoyed this one a lot.  I was also struck by how easy the powders dissolve – there’s none of that residual sludge on the bottom of my cup no matter how much I stir. I realize they may have been formulated for machine use but they work fine straight into the cup.  The number and distribution of flavors I received wasn’t even - literally: I counted only eleven flavors rather then twelve as advertised - and there were only singles of the Peanut Butter Cup and Carnival flavors. Not a big deal – there’s plenty in the forty samples that are really good - but true obsessives may complain.  Bottom line: If you’re used to the big commercial cocoas give your palette a vacation and explore some alternative flavors. You probably won’t like everything in the sample pack, but you’ll no doubt discover some new favorites – but don’t be surprised if that free"

388914,148591,"sample and see.<br />I got it a few months ago, put it on for a few days, noticed nothing different, and thought, oh well. So I put it in a drawer and forgot about it.<br /><br />Then this week I was playing a lot of guitar one night; sometimes I'll practice 4, 6 or even 8 hours straight while watching movies or reading or just wailing away. And after a few hours my left wrist and fingers can get pretty sore, and I have to take frequent breaks. My inner voice said, \\""Hey bozo, where's that copper bracelet?\\""<br /><br />I dug it out and put it on.<br />And to my great and happy surprise, my wrist and finger tendons slowly stopped feeling sore.<br /><br />I kept playing for over 7 hours total, and felt great afterwards. So I wore this thing to bed. Slept well, maybe a little better than normal but nothing spectacular. But then the next day I decided to really test this thing out, and I plugged in and started playing riffs like mad, every Zep, Jimi, Floyd, ZZ, Santana, Van Halen etc solo and song I could remember, for hours on end. Hundreds of riffs and solos, blasting away, playing as fast as I could to see what happened to my wrist.<br /><br />Incredibly, I played four hours with only a brief break, and NO wrist pain!<br /><br />The only thing I had changed was wearing this bracelet. So I know it does work, for me, for this issue. But what makes it work? Is it the copper, which is said to enter your bloodstream very gently while mixing with your sweat, and balance your brain chemistry a little better as well? Is it the six magnets? That could be it, as I believe we are being massively hurt by the wireless frequencies we are all now surrounded by every day, all day and night. We are very sensitive electromagnetic beings, and the cell phone grid is now all-pervasive; how can that be good for our bodies' magnetic fields?<br /><br />Well, whatever makes this work, it DOES work. For me, at least. It's more than just a little discernible; it stops my wrist pain. I also seem to feel a bit more balanced and grounded while wearing it, and my temper seems a little more stable while driving. Copper bracelets for road rage!<br /><br />This is pure copper, and very flexible, easy to get on and off and easy to shape to my wrist perfectly. I wear it with the opening on top, as that seems to work better for me and be more comfortable. I hate jewelry and wear no rings or watch etc, but this doesn't bug me at all, got used to it in hours. It also doesn't leave a green mark on my wrist as others say some copper bracelets do to them.<br /><br />If this thing was bunk, I'd say so in two seconds. But I've felt the difference and I know it works for me.<br />Do all copper bracelets work? No idea, I've only tried this one. Some cost only six bucks, while this is almost 30.<br />Is it worth it? If it works, it sure is. Try a few and see, and then please write a review"

[Update: Truecolours09 reminded me that the sample is from Inner City 'Good Life]'He About To Lose Me' is a immediate standout as the music to it is the only track not to have dance/eltro overtones and it has the most natural vocals. Listening to the song properly reveals that the lyrics are strong too - she's bored of her dead-end relationship and is about to end it and go of with someone else she meets at a club. I don't know why this track is only a bonus one and isn't on the tracklist for her regular edition of the U.S. album; it could have been a hit and been huge on the airwaves. What a waste.     'Selfish' is sort of a dance version of the previous track. Britney is intending to think of herself and pick up someone to take back home, but they'll be doing what she wants to do for her pleasure.       This isn't to say I don't like the other tracks - I do like everything on here and can warble [at least] a few lines to everything else on offer here, it's just that the above tracks hooked me in straightaway and the above mentioned tracks are the ones that I've listened to most often and have added to various playlists on my Ipod.       There is only one track on the album that I would class as a filler and that is the Will.I.am featured 'Big Fat Bass', and this isn't pierce-my-ears-with-a-knitting-needle awful and I don't skip it, even though it tends to irritate me. I like the music to it, but Will.I.am doesn't add much to the song and I find the highly repetitive lyrics annoying. Observe; I can be the treble baby, you can be the bass, you can be the bass, you can be the bass. Repeat about a hundred times - and the bad thing is that I'm not exaggerating by much [I suspect that Will.I.am gave her an BEP album outtake].

417308,1564568,"sample of Jane Austen's hair, she was compelled her to write her novel - fiction yes, but based deeply upon fact.<br /><br />The novel opens in 1843, twenty-six years after Jane Austen's death. Anne Sharp has learned of the new Marsh test that can be conducted on human hair to discover if arsenic poisoning might have killed its owner. Torn between departing with the memento and learning the truth, she sends it off to be analyzed. The results will inspire her to write down a memoir of her friend and all of the events that lay out her theories and why. A catharsis act to release all the years of pent up frustration and anger of her dear friends death, which she truly believes was not natural, but by design. And, by someone, who had both strong motive and means in Jane's family circle.<br /><br />She begins in 1805 when Anne and Jane were introduced at Godmersham Park in Kent and continues through 1843 with the result of the test that concludes her suspicions. What unfolds is a fascinating journey into the Austen family dynamics. What is revealed will raise more than a few eyebrows. At times, I was shocked, repulsed and offended, but, I read on, and on, so mesmerized by the story that Miss Sharp reveals of her employer Edward Knight, his brothers James and Henry, their wives and their children that I read into the wee hours of the night. Like Catherine Morland obsessed with Gothic fiction I could not stop. However, unlike NORTHANGER ABBEY, THE MYSTERIOUS DEATH OF MISS AUSTEN is not a high burlesque parody. It is a serious mystery novel based on historical fact.<br /><br />Ashford's writing is honest, grating and intriguing. Bare to the bone with human folly of biblical proportions, I am purposely vague in my plot description for fear of revealing anything that would spoil the discovery and surprise for the reader. Ashford has captured the Jane Austen, and her intimate family circle, within my mind's eye with sensitivity, perception and reproving guile. What unfolds is a gripping, page turning, toxic sugar plum unlike any other Austenesque novel I have ever read. Be brave. Be beguiled. Be uncertain. I dare you.<br /><br />Laurel Ann, Austenproser the skull with her own shin-bone\\"" to solve a mystery close to two hundred years old. There is, however, one element that could solve the mystery. Her hair. We know her sister Cassandra sent sections of it to family members and to Miss Sharp as mementos after her death. Some examples still exist. The Jane Austen House Museum at Chawton owns one. If tested it might reveal the truth.    We know that Jane Austen was a perceptive observer of people and events in her novels and in her own life. In 1817 when she had a brief remission in her fatal illness and wrote a letter on March 23rd to her favorite niece Fanny Knight. In it she supplies us with some very important evidence of her physical condition and the appearance of her face:  \\""I certainly have not been very well for many weeks, and about a week ago I was very poorly, I have had a good deal of fever at times and indifferent nights, but am considerably better now and recovering my looks a little, which have been bad enough, BLACK AND WHITE AND EVERY WRONG COLOUR. I must not depend upon ever being blooming again.  Sickness is a dangerous indulgence at my time of life.\\""  These six words piqued Lindsay Ashford's training in criminology from Queens' College, Cambridge. Severe discoloring of the face are signs of arsenic poisoning. Coupled with the amazing discovery that arsenic testing"

I've used this feature upon occasion with my Kindle 2 when my eyes were tired, or a few times out of pure curiosity. The feature usually works well once the user learns how and when to use the controls, but I might suggest that it not be tried on your Kindle. A number of pages in, my Kindle started acting up, and I thought that it was [[ASIN:B001OB662K speaking in tongues]]... and then it locked up.  I did a Kindle reset, and all was fine, so I tried the text-to-speech option successfully on a number of other titles.  But when I tried it again on Ms. Strong-Anderson's e-book again, the Kindle became locked up once again, and had to be reset.  I didn't try it again, but use caution if you try it.  Your experience mayvary.<br /><br />◆ Summary:<br /><br />It's hard to explain my reactions to this often rambling dissertation, as I often had to put it down.  Curiosity made me take a large section of this author's tract and do a grammar check on it, and it ended up with a Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 5.1.  This was actually surprising considering the massive amount of grammar and typographic errors.<br /><br />It was published by AuthorHouse in 2008, and this company is known as a \\""self-publishing\\"" business, one of those where you pay your money to have your book published.  I can only guess that Eliyzabeth Yanne Strong-Anderson didn't buy their proofing package or that the editors there have even lower grammar skills than does Ms. Strong-Anderson.  And I want to tread lightly here as the author profile on her paper copy of this book states that she has \\""A 1ST DEGREE BLACK BELT IN TAEJUKENPO KARATE.\\""  I never heard of Taejukenpo Karate before and cannot find any 'Net references to it other than those referring to anyone other than this author.<br /><br />The overuse of uppercase and the frequent typographic errors gave me a splitting headache while reading it, yet at times I found Ms. Strong-Anderson's treatise to be absolutely hilarious.  And I often wonder about authors who seem to have a frequent focus on body parts to the point that it seems obsessive.<br /><br />Some parts of this are yawningly boring beyond description. I had thought Dan Brown's [[ASIN:0307950689 The Lost Symbol]] had been difficult to get through at over 600 pages in paperback, a 3-star offering even with a lot of coffee, but this one is far worse.  Dan Brown's book had at least some form of a plot; this does not, unless I've been blinded by upper case letters.<br /><br />You could also opt for the 600 page [[ASIN:0833030477 A Million Random Digits with 100,000 Normal Deviates]] from Rand Corporation, a reprint of their classic 1955 book consisting primarily of a random number table generated by an electronic simulation of a roulette wheel attached to a computer. For some readers, this may be more exciting and make more sense.<br /><br />It was interesting to see that in the section below the paperback edition of this book is the regular section \\""Customers Who Viewed This Item Also Viewed\\"" which contained links to [[ASIN:B005OSVZN4 this item]] and [[ASIN:1578632978 this gem]], among other items.  These seem somewhat appropriate, though the author might disagree.<br /><br />So in conclusion, how would I subjectively rate Ms. Eliyzabeth Yanne Strong-Anderson's work here?<br /><br />If it was a Kindle free"

If you have restorations, crowns, caps or bridges then you will WANT AND NEED to keep these by your tootbrush and floss if you want to keep those expensive dental restorations from having to be removed and redone due to new decay.<br /><br />These flossing aids are not like the cheap wisps of plastic hot melded together that you buy in the grocery store. No, these are molded with an easy to thread eye and are sturdy enough for you to thread under multiple bridges in one session without the eye breaking or coming apart. I use one of these a day and can't stand to be without them. In truth, when I have been low, I have washed them in oral wash and re-used them but I don't ever want to have to do that again. Therefore I keep a good stock of these. If you have been using those flimsy green or blue DenTek Floss Threaders-50 ct , then you are NOT able to rigorously floss under your bridges and down beneath the gumline between tight crowns. The same goes for those little hand-held flossers that shred when faced with a tightly fitted crown.<br /><br />Bridgeaid is what I have been using for years and before I began using them, I had an awful time getting the store bough brand to thread UNDER the bridge. This glide right under and up due to their shape. It beats STABBING your gums and cheeks with the other kind that are too thin and flimsy to slide thru on the first try and which are not polished on the ends.  Bridgeaid has a molded design that holds its curved shape and the end of it is polished smooth.  Yes, it takes a little practice but once you've gotten the hang of it, you'll love them and never go back to DENTEK.<br /><br />They are also worth the money because you only have to use ONE per flossing session and it will not come apart as others do. You save time using these as well. Don't hesitate. if your dentist gave you some and you think you can get by with the flimsy ones, I'm telling you not to bother. It's pennywise and pound foolish. You'll save SO MUCH MORE money in the gumline and under-bridge cavities you prevent by using these regularly.<br /><br />The one thing I would advise, however is to check AMAZON PRIME for these.  Often the orice is a buck or two more but the shipping is free"

So that worked better than anything I've ever tried for the purpose.<br /><br />The protector itself goes on smoothly, sticks firmly, doesn't interfere with the screen's ability to sense touch, and protects the surface.<br /><br />The only drawback is that you have to watch out for bubbles. They're tricky to avoid, and once the protector is on, it's ON, so peeling it off to remove bubbles is difficult, and then leaves a permanent crease in the corner where you do finally manage to peel it off. I did much better with the second protector than the first, and the best trick I found was to NOT use my thumb to smooth out bubbles as they appeared, but stop mid-application, and pull the plastic up just a tiny bit, then to use the lifted part (in my hand) to press down firmly (so the protector was almost L-shaped during application, although I was careful not to crease), and move slowly, lifting a teensy bit any time a bubble appeared, and then pressing down again until that portion was bubble-free"

In general I'm not a fan of sequels--in fact I hated Aliens (Alien 2)--because all too often they simply rehash the same story, the same characters both good and bad, the same sets and special effects, etc.  But Alien Resurrection twists the Alien series in a unique way.  We get plenty of the familiar but updated superbly--the alien is back, redesigned to move somewhat differently and a bit sleeker, the face-huggers and chestburster make cameos, the queen returns with a much more terrifying mouth, and of course Ripley is back again, this time as a human/alien hybrid, colder, less compassionate and more distant, much harder to empathise with.  Special effects are more than superb, as is a consistent hallmark of the series.  The new creature, and the hybrids 1-7 (the most harrowing scene in the film!) are spectacularly monstrous.  The crew of the Betty, especially Winona Ryder as the new empathetic character Annalee Call, Ron Perlman as Crewman Johner, Dominique Pinon as the wheelchair-bound Chief Mechanic Vriess, and a very brief appearance by Michael Wincott (who recently stole the show as Gary Soneji in Along Came a Spider), are a superbly cast lot of misfits seemingly as alien as the creatures themselves.  The film revels in the quirky, too; with the casting of Dan Hedaya as General Perez, in the camera shot down the throat of a &quot;cannon-fodder&quot; character, and in Brad Dourif's eerie mugging with the alien.  Some viewers might well have found these touches distracting, but they gave a real sense of individuality from director Jean-Pierre Jeunet.  Some critics have decried the film as simply a chase through empty rooms in which aliens occassionally pop up, but it was so much more than that--the film was an exploration of the interplay of relationships between characters, and between characters and aliens, which was far more than just kill or be killed.  It has always been noteworthy that the Corporation is as inhuman as the creatures; but now the creatures are more human, with jealousies, erotic drives, planning, revenge, teamwork, murder, and natural childbirth(!); while the humans are more physically alien than ever before.  Ultimately it is probably that Alien Resurrection delivered something unexpected, with subtleties beyond the typical Hollywood sequel fare, that has led to the number of unfavorable review"

I tried using significant force to try to flex handles on this cookware and they did not budge. The thickness of metal used of all the pieces is as good as other brands costing much more.<br /><br />The handles are comfortable to hold and stay cool, an impotent consideration when holding a pot that's fairly heavy in contents. Each handle has an eyelet at end in case you hang you pots on a hook.<br />The glass covers are well made, fit tight, and the glass can offer some viewing of contents instead of having to lift the cover to check if you must reduce heat or if something is bubbling or spattering a bit too much.<br /><br />I'm not sure how the glass would hold up if the cover were dropped onto a hard floor (versus a solid cover), and that might be the only issue if you sometimes get a case of \\""butter-fingers\\"".<br /><br />I liked the large knobs on each cover. They are easy to hold, even with wet hands and are spaced well away from the hot glass top surface so there's little to no chance of getting a finger or knuckle burn like on some smaller knobs spaced closer to the cover as used on some other brands of cookware I've seen.<br /><br />As other review"

451091,538469,"sample of the game's artwork, I have to say I'm quite satisfied with the outcome. I still prefer Twilight Princess' realistic style, but Skyward Sword looks great. The characters look alive and they have a wide range of facial and emotional expressions.<br /><br />The landscapes and stages are at least asdetailed as in Twilight Princess. From a distance, the impressionistic style works really well. Sadly, unlike Twilight Princess, there's no Hyrule FIeld, which was always my favorite part. Also, the other landscapes don't quite have that epic feel and almost look like they could have come out of a kid's game. Make no mistake - they look good, but not quite epic.<br /><br />SOUND<br /><br />Because Skyward Sword has such a deep story, it's all the more disappointing that Skyward Sword doesn't have voice acting. The on-screen dialogue text worked for past Zelda games because the dialogue was short and often transactional in nature. However, there are cinematic cutscenes in Skyward Sword and the text dialogue just becomes a chore to read and really detracts from the story. Worst of all is when there's dialogue on the screen but the character's lips aren't movie.<br /><br />The soundtrack is good, but not quite at the level of Twilight Princess or Ocarina of Time. Again, as with the rest of the game, it's more lighthearted. It's tough to really judge while playing the game, so I'll have to wait until the full soundtrack is available for download.<br /><br />GAMEPLAY<br /><br />This is where Skyward Sword really shines. While I don't think the swordplay is necessarily a revolution, it does add a new dimension to the game. You actually have to think about HOW you slash and hack. The Wii MotionPlus or its equivalent will definitely be standard for any future Zelda games.<br /><br />OVERALL<br /><br />Skyward Sword is really hard to rate because it both exceeds expectations and disappoints. The impressionistic art style didn't bother me nearly as much as I'd feared. On the other hand, the game just feels a whole lot less epic than Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time, and especially Twilight Princess. I'll write an updated review"

This would probably work but I found that the additional weight on top of my helmet was unacceptable - the camera weighs 4.4 ounces - seemingly trivial but noticeable on top of your head.  At five megapixels, the still picture capability is adequate but nothing special.

Amber Moon was actually a bit better than the first, Black Moon, but I was surprised by the shift from shifters - um, well the change in focus from the cat shifters of the first book to the elven court in this one. The first book was really thin storywise but Bevill did a bit better in this one, though there is still some oddness to the writing that makes it feel more like a fanfict than an actual book, and there are still some technical issues which are noticable to even a not-at-all-technical reader like me (words used oddly if not incorrectly and wrong words missed by spell check).<br /><br />There are some creative ideas here and the female lead was actually fairly interesting, the male elven lead didn't have enough screen time to make him much more than a beautiful cutout (even though the bit we know of his history gave him potential.) And having read all three books, mate bonds are the author's favorite device to cement a relationship - this book unlike the others doesn't have any sex though. There is an attempt here at an overarching plot, the first book didn't have that sense at all, but the story ends fairly abruptly and picks right back up in the next book Silver Moon, so if you are considering reading Amber Moon you probably want to have Silver Moon waiting to go when you are finished (if it is still free"

I definitely liked the shiatsu over the rolling massage, but the whole thing wasn't nearly hard enough for me. <br /> <br />I didn't even stay for the full 15 minutes, so I just shut it off. Later, I went back and flipped up the padded cushion to see what it'd be like without it. Well, THAT was strong enough for the most part. Whoa! That shiatsu thing just pounds the heck out of those muscles. Very nice indeed. <br /> <br />My husband went to try it, and like I thought, it was still too rough on him, even with the padded cover. I folded a down throw over the back of the massager, and that provided enough padding even for his bony back. He said, \\""I think I could get to like this!\\"" which is high praise indeed. <br /> <br />(I should note the directions say NOT to put anything over the massager, as I did with the down throw. Well, it was either that, or he'd put on a few sweaters. I couldn't see the difference since the massager wasn't being obstructed, and he didn't go the full 15 minutes.) <br /> <br />It's been an hour or so since I did the 15 minutes of shiatsu, and I have to say, you really feel it LATER. Maybe I overdid the hard stuff! Or maybe I just need another 15 minutes with some padding! <br /> <br />I have never tried one of those cool massaging chairs (damned things are always broken when I think to stop by a store in the mall that sells them), so this massager - the highend of the Homedics line - is, as those who've tried massaging chairs say, very similar.  <br /> <br />It's a little pricey right now, but look for that to drop.

482064,2149415,"sample commands, usually including Power, and a list of other commands which are defined but not enabled at this point.  Most devices will respond to common commands that are in multiple codesets, so your best bet is to scan the list of defined commands to see if they might be found on your device's remote.  Trying the sample commands is not difficult, but they often won't give you sufficient information as to whether you've made the right choice. When you select a codeset there is a couple of minute delay while the whole set is loaded into the RedEye.  If you later find you chose incorrectly, there's another couple of minute delay while the old information is removed and you have to start over again at the brand selection.<br /><br />If you find that your device has a command that is not in the database, the RedEye can learn it from your existing remote, though there are some limitations as to how you can use these commands.<br /><br />If you cannot find a matching codeset, you can inquire at the Thinkflood user forum and the support engineers are usually good about finding the right codeset for you. If they don't have one, they have to ask their \\""supplier\\"" to define one, and this may take a week or more.  I asked Thinkflood if they had a user-searchable database of model numbers, and was told that they were planning one but it did not exist yet.  I had become so used to the painless way that Logitech Harmony remotes are programmed that this seemed to me a giant step backward in usability.  By the way, you are not allowed to look at the user forum until you register your device and have your application accepted.  This took about a day for me.<br /><br />Ok, so you get your devices programmed.  Then what?  You can add activities, such as \\""Watch TV\\"", \\""Watch a DVD\\"", etc.  The system will put together an initial set of commands to send to the various devices to accomplish this, though you may have to fine tune them by changing the order, changing or inserting delays, adding commands to select inputs, etc.<br /><br />Now you have an activity programmed and you select it on the device.  Do you have a full-featured remote now?  No. What you get is a screen of basic buttons including a direction pad and digits, volume and channel up and down and power.  But no device commands such as play, pause, rewind or the \\""color\\"" buttons on so many remotes.  You will then have to add these buttons, one at a time.  For each one, you select the device and the function.  A button image then appears on the screen and you can drag it to where you want it to appear.  (This reminded me a lot of ProntoEdit from many years ago.) The predefined buttons images are rather large, all the better for hitting with your finger, and there is not a lot of screen real estate for them, even on an iPad.  The remote screen is scrollable, so you may want to experiment with placing frequently used commands at the top.  There are guide lines displayed that help you line up the buttons.<br /><br />Now you might be asking why, even on an iPad, isn't there much screen real estate for the buttons.  The answer is that half the iPad screen is occupied by a program guide that displays which programs are on in the current timeslot.  (On the iPhone/iPod, the guide is on a separate tab.) Tapping one of the programs changes the channel to that program.  Those of you with multiple program sources might ask which device does it pick?  The answer is that you must select one and only one activity for the guide.  In my house, we have two DVRs, and if I'm watching one and the guide is associated with the other, tapping a guide entry switches me away to the other DVR - which may or may not have the same channels available to it.<br /><br />In my review"

Each of these sheets are scored on one side to make them user-friendly.<br /><br />We decided to taste these and found them to be pretty &#34;fishy.&#34; It does taste much like the wrapping on the sushi that we buy so that is really not a complaint.<br /><br />My husband was fine eating this stuff raw but for me it will be an acquired taste. I'm doubtful that I'll ever enjoy it raw or use it to replace bread on a sandwich although some people have used it that way.<br /><br />I think this will work fine for homemade sushi and also soup garnishes. It seems to be reasonably priced and the bag is self sealing for storing. It is recommended that you keep it in the refrigerator after opening so it should be fine for multiple uses.

Before actually tasting them I took a photo of the samples side-by-side under the same lighting. Note that the Hellman’s mayo is very slightly more yellow in color. This is apparent when looking at the product inside the jar as well.<br /><br />Here are the taste results: combining the results of 3 tests, the Hellman’s was VERY slightly more tangy, which I identified as a little more of a lemon taste. They do not taste the same! It’s not an earth-shaking difference, mind you, but the difference is enough to notice. Neither tasted “better” (and I realize most people don’t eat their mayo from the tip of a spoon). But the taste is not identical. Now, you are probably dying to know how they both compared to Kraft Mayo (which is the brand I reluctantly use these days). Okay, I have never “loved” Kraft Mayo. I buy it because it’s cheaper and for the reason discussed below. Compared to both Best Foods and Hellman’s the Kraft Mayo tastes a little more of eggs, but it also tastes a little more of a very slight chemical flavor. I can only describe it as not tasting as “pure”. It is my least favorite of the three.he taste test I bought a jar of Best Foods mayo at my local store. I approached the taste test as seriously as any food or beverage tester would approach any test and the results are as fair as I could possibly make them in my home kitchen.<br /><br />For the purpose of this review"

This isn't a large amount of lotion (only 8 ounces), but rather one I'll keep on my desk to moisturize my hands as needed during the day.

The Mee Bee Moisturized lotion is a perfect solution.<br /><br />After using the lotion, my hands regained their natural softness and the dry look disappeared.

I do find that concentrated ones such as the Mee Beauty, go much further on my body than larger containers of rather watered down ones.

Once you see what the truth is about the lack of true insulation properties of the common vinyl window, you will all the more want solid wood windows. Combining the insulating properties of solid wood, with the natural weather resistance of mahogany, and you have a combination that is hard to beat. I am leaning toward the single glass, and then doubling that on the inside with a removable storm panel, and tripling it with an exterior storm window. (That is a popular Pella design)<br />  What is significantly different is with typical &quot;insulated glass&quot; windows, you have a vinyl shell, which conducts cold instead of insulating, and then passes that cold through the aluminum wedge that is sealed between the glass, which also transmits cold readily, on through to the inner glass, which is cold on the outer areas, and only warm on the inside center. Consequently the major window testing"

515130,1058065,"sample seemed like a good idea as we've had to do that before with our elderly cat and it was a pain.<br /><br />The Purr Fect Potty is easy to put together and well made. It's a finely crafted litter box and it looks great. However, our pets refuse to consider it a litter box. They simply don't know what to make of this thing.<br /><br />We have three other cat litter boxes in the house, one is a hooded box like this but much bigger and with steps for our elderly cat to get in and out of. One is the [[ASIN:B000JZOQO2 Merry Pet Cat Washroom / Night Stand Pet House]] which looks and works great. The other is a regular litter box with a high back to prevent spraying. So you would think the Purr Fect Potty would be something easy to adjust to. Well it isn't the refuse to go to the bathroom in it. The kitten plays with the pine pellets like a little human child plays in a ballroom. The elderly cat uses it as a bed. Not once have they gone to the bathroom in it.<br /><br />We suspect it is because the pine litter looks like rabbit pellets. We have an eight year old hare that is definitely the boss of the two cats. She's territorial and very aggressive if either cat tries to use her litter boxes. So either the cats think that because it smells and looks like rabbit food, they are not using it or they simply don't like the thing as it was intended.<br /><br />Checking other review"

They won't be breaking any records for most realistic, but the characters dance fluidly and the backgrounds are vibrant and easy on the eyes.  I really enjoyed seeing the different settings such as the graffiti-painted tunnels, club environment, and street locations.<br /><br />Something I was pleasantly surprised about was that you get to create a customized character for every player with a save file in the game.  You can customize gender, face, hair, skin tone, shirt, pants, shoes, accessories, tattoos, glasses, and more.  It's not as deep as creating The Sims, but it allows for some very unique creations when you get to make your own personal dancers.

Game-show hysterics. I smelled the baby in there somewhere, the cloying odor of baby powder and feces. Something moved, and then I saw the child on her back on a threadbare couch the color of green Easter-basket straw. She was naked like a big chocolate candy, kicking her little legs. \\""Well, isn't Shareeka just adorable,\\"" I said, bending toward her.

There's a little romance and some sex, but mostly just the crazy antics of Elsie (Promo Girl) and her friends.  I absolutely loved Elsie, she was so refreshingly honest and upfront about everything.  I'm so tired of books about round-heeled, whiny, &#34;Woe is me&#34; women, who do nothing but get drunk and party but cry if anyone looks at them hard!!  The books are so descriptive, I felt as though I were watching a movie (in fact it could make a great comedy).  I had a couple of nitpicks, but not enough to bring my rating down.  Highly recommended for those who like well-written, funny books.  Review"

Good luck with your book sales and good luck with whatever life brings you next.nutty city and state taxes have driven most of the film industry out of the area, but the porn industry is still doing OK.  And as this book points out, those jobs are real money, and every dollar of local income is spent an average of six times again in the community (I think my Econ 201 class called that \\""the velocity of money\\"").  So the notion of a guy in his basement in New Hampshire giving our Valley porn industry such a competitive fight was fascinating to me.  I love competition in the marketplace; it's good for business and it's good for the customers.<br /><br />This story spans a fifteen year career, where he built up a homegrown business starting with nothing and turning it into a very thriving enterprise.  It's an incredible story.  And for a guy whose profession is producing smut, this man's ethics really impressed me.  Putting aside my bias against his product, this man has an incredible work ethic and he has an enterprising motor in him that drove him and drove him.  I was very impressed with his creativity, his ability to research and implement new technologies, and his sense of right and wrong when it came to what he would and wouldn't include in his products.<br /><br />All in all, this was a very interesting story.  Most of the time I was rooting for his success.  Sometimes I found myself politely nodding but politely disagreeing.  And sometimes I cringed at the turn of events when things didn't go his way.<br /><br />I was genuinely sorry when the story ended.  I wanted to read more, but he wrote right up to the present, so it would have taken a time machine for him to tell more of the story.  I also had TONS of questions when I finished, but for personal reasons he had to leave some of the details out and change some of the names of the players.  So be it.  He still divulged way more than I would have expected someone in that position to divulge.<br /><br />So who should read this book?  For starters: adults.  I wouldn't recommend it to my mom.I probably wouldn't even admit to mom that I read this.  But I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to my wife and I probably wouldn't hide it from my adult kids.

I usually take an intensity 8 Roma for the morning and anywhere between 3-6 in the afternoon. Even as I make a cappucino each time, I find that with the Aerocino machine I end up using LESS milk than in the past when I was simply microwaving half a cup of milk, and the cappucino comes out perfect every time.<br /><br />-Some users complained that the aerocino didn't heat up the milk hot enough. I never had a problem; the espresso itself coming out of the Pixie is very hot; if you make the milk first, pour it into a cup, and then run the espresso machine, you will end up with that nice '3-layer' cup of cappuccino AND it will be exactly the perfect temperature.<br/>-very very VERY easy to clean the aerocino<br />-as another review"

581582,1894803,"sample of the Derma E Hyaluronic cream and had really never heard of hyaluronic acid, although I had heard of a village in Japan where people live for an especially long time.<br /><br />After using the face cream on a daily basis and after about a week, I took a second look in the mirror and my skin was literally \\""plumper\\"" as if it was more hydrated and healthy. About a week later, an article about hyaluronic acid appeared (as articles often do when looking for answers).<br /><br />I have also started buying \\""HA\\"" as a dietary supplement in tablet form after reading about people in Japan who eat a sticky gelatinous root vegetable instead of rice have smooth skin, flexible joints and full heads of hair even when they are quite old. Researchers have finally concluded that they have unusually high levels of hyaluronic acid in their bodies.<br /><br />This eye cr&egrave;me is especially potent because it contains not only hyaluronic acid, it also contains pycnogenol. Derma-E has a few products that are ahead of their time. My esthetician had not even heard of pycnogenol.<br /><br />These amazing discoveries seem to take years and years to filter down through our society and the fact that the product works so well, should mean everyone in the skin care industry is talking about it. Fortunately Derma-E is producing wonderful anti-aging products that have dramatic results in a short amount of time.<br /><br />So what will this new Pycnogenol and Hyaluronic Acid Eye Cream do for you? Well, since it seems to plump up the skin a bit in a noticeable way, you will want to use this cream in areas where you want to visibly reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Your skin will take on a smoother appearance and you might also find yourself hunting down Pycnogenol and Hyaluronic Acid in pill form.<br /><br />It has taken me years to finally find products that promise and deliver and Derma E is a line of natural skin care products that visibly change your appearance in a matter of weeks. They have obtained licensees to use proprietary ingredients and they also believe in adding antioxidants to their products.<br /><br />This cr&egrave;me itself absorbs quickly and you will start to see noticeable results in a short amount of time. The Hyaluronic Acid firms, tones and rehydrates the skin and Pycnogenol is 50X more powerful than Vitamin E. So, if you want your skin to heal super fast, you can also use a bit of this cr&egrave;me in place of Vitamin E.<br /><br />Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Witch Hazel Extract, Capric Triglyceride, Green Tea Extract, Aloe Vera Gel, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetyl Alcohol, Jojoba Oil, Xanthan Gum, Allatoin, Panthenol, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Pycnogenol, Hyaluronic Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, I.Urea.<br /><br />Additional Products I've tried and loved:<br /><br />Microdermabrasion Scrub - Salon Quality exfoliation right in your own home!<br /><br />Astazanthin and Pycnogenol Age-Defying Moisturizing Cr&egrave;me<br /><br />Cracked Skin Relief Cr&egrave;me<br /><br />Vanilla Bean Cleansing Mousse<br /><br />Tea Tree & E Antiseptic Cr&egrave;me<br /><br />Vitamin A Retinyl Palmitate Wrinkle Treatment Cr&egrave;me - love the scent of this product!<br /><br />~TheRebeccaReview"

If I have to use my finger to shove the slide around on the platform I won't have the delicate control & so it makes the job harder.<br /><br />*Instruction manual: The Celestron manual is easy to follow and has multiple translations (English, German, Spanish, etc.) The Barska owners manual was seriously lacking and obviously not written by a native English speaker - someone not familiar with microscopes will be challenged figuring things out as the manual is no help. However, the Barska did have a CD in the case. It was completely unlabeled, so I have no idea if it was instructions, software to go with transferring images from the microscope or what, so perhaps it would have had some helpful information.<br /><br />*Special & other features: I didn't test the picture taking features or using the optional SD card memory on either, so I can't comment there. However, the navigation on the Celestron was more intuitive. The Celestron comes with an adaptable plug that can pop in plugs for most nationalities (there's about 5 different ones in the case) The Barska had just a solid plug for standard Americas plugs. Both come with a small case of about 5 prepared slides to play around with. Both have the option of lighting from top, bottom or both. The Barska top light was on a bendable wire so that you could better focus it on the object being viewed, whereas the top light on the Celestron is not adjustable. However, the bendable feature didn't help the Barska at all, as no matter how I moved it the images on the Celsestron were brighter and more clear (as you'll see on the images I hope to upload...) I tried adding supplemental lighting to \\""brighten up\\"" the image on the Barska, but it didn't help, so perhaps the darkness is related to something with the viewing screen instead(?) Hmmm - that one I just can't figure out.<br /><br />Other than the details mentioned above, the two microscopes are quite similar. The Barska \\""looks\\"" nicer because of the chrome detailing, however, that obviously doesn't make up for it's poor performance when compared to the Celestron.<br /><br />Summary: Buy the Celestron not this Barska! It doesn't have any black spots on the screen - ignore those older review"

I've put about four movies on it and they work fine, although one I may have to reload because the movement on the screen is a little choppy for some reason.  Converting DVDs to .avi takes a while, so I usually do this in the background while doing something else.  Transfering the file to the Archos only takes a few minutes.      I see many complaints about the fact that you have to buy extra accessories, which is apparently true for most any Archos PMP. You should, of course, do your research ahead of time and figure those costs in the final price before you make the decision to buy it in the first place.  If you want any cables, the docking station, etc. add those into the total cost when you compare, presuming that whatever you are comparing it to has these already included.  I have ordered the docking station but it has not yet arrived, so I can't comment on its usefulness (or lack thereof).  I also bought the two plug-ins online at the Archos web site.  I knew in advance that I would incur these costs in addition to the cost of the 604 if I wanted them.  Considering the price I got if for on Amazon, though, I still considered it to be a good buy.Several comments have also been made regarding the sound quality of the speaker.  Well, of course it's bad! It is a tiny little thing on a faily small device, so don't expect thundering surround sound.  All I use it for is to make sure that the movies I have transferred to it did transfer successfully with the sound. In that respect, it's pretty handy to have.    I plan to use this to watch movies while traveling by plane, and I think it is perfect for that purpose.  It is heavier than I thought it would be and IMO it is not a good choice if you mainly want MP3.  There are many lighter options for this with probably better sound quality.  In no way would you want to go jogging with this thing; it's simply not made for that.    If you do decide to buy this device or another model, check out [...] to get some useful tips on using it.  For newbies like me in regard to file conversion, a great resource on this site is [...] which guides you step-by-step.    All in all I have been pleased with my purchase and will probably buy a second one to give as a gift.  I do recommend it.      EDIT 05/30/08:  I have had this unit for about seven months now and continue to be pleased with it.  I have it continually sitting in the docking station to charge and have learned how to set the timer. So, while in the docking cradle, it will turn on my Dish receiver, turn it to the correct channel, record the program and then turn the receiver off.

You have to push the gel out of the pouch and to get all of it, you are going to have to treat the pouch like a tube of toothpaste.<br /><br />FLAVOR<br />I think right after consistency, flavor is what you are going to want to know about.  The flavor is indeed like fruit punch.  A jello-y flavor that was quite good.<br /><br />SUMMARY<br />My main concern with this review"

While I handle much of the sound playback and recording for my church, I don't typically purchase hardware for myself, so I'm not a recording guru with a home studio or the like.<br /><br />But, having handled plenty of sound hardware, I'm impressed by this little unit and its performance. It's a rock-solid, but practically tiny, simple interface that does what it does very well. I would consider Amazon's $150 price tag well worth it if you record voice audio or podcasts. In fact, given the USB-power and small size this is a perfect podcast setup paired with a mic and laptop. Like other review"

616787,2771067,"sample pair of these &#34;running&#34; socks in a size small, color purple, and I have to agree with Zensah's slogan -- these are definitely the most comfortable pair of socks I've ever owned.<br /><br />If you look at the packaging and read the product page, you will see a list of all the features of this sock, including that it provides nice, thick cushioning, fits tight, is made with seamlesss technology and contains some copper in the fibers. What does all of this add up to -- well, a sock that wicks moisture away and fits snugly to your foot and arches, and also reduces the odor caused by sweating. Despite what science might say, I wear a lot of copper to combat minor arthritis (such as a bracelet on each wrist), and I do believe that it provides some type of benefit. I spend a LOT of time on my feet walking on concrete flooring, so having great arch support is a must. In combination with proper shoes, I do think these socks, with their zone ribbing, support arches. The lack of seams in the socks mean that I don't get blisters from the rubbing.<br /><br />I love the design of these colorful socks and would definitely want to purchase them in the other colors. The short ankle height is perfect for wearing with athletic shoes, especially in warmer weather. I did not notice my feet being any warmer in these than with other socks that I own.<br /><br />Others have commented on the price, and I have always been a believer in that you get what you pay for. So far these wash and dry well and there are no pills or unraveling, but only time will tell how the cushioning and other features hold up with repeated wearing. I definitely will update this review"

UPDATE: NOV 11 2010<br />11.A Kindle App for the iPad vs. iBooks on the iPad<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------<br />- Little to choose between Kindle App and iBooks on the iPad as far as interface is concerned.<br />- Both allow you to flip through pages using the tap or swipe gesture.<br />- Both have menus that disappear as you read, but popup at a tap.<br />- Both allow you to place ribbon shaped bookmarks.<br />- Both have sliders that you can use to jump to any place in the book.<br />- Both allow you to change the font size and the brightness of the display.<br /><br />- However, when it comes to font size adjustment, you can select from a list of font sizes on the Kindle app.<br />- On iBooks you basically tap the larger font icon to successively increase the font size, and the smaller font icon to reduce the size. Works but not as intuitive.<br /><br />- iBooks has a beautiful bookshelf metaphor as its library interface. Every book you add to your library is placed on this virtual bookshelf. Looks very nice.You miss this on the physical Kindle.<br /><br />11.B Kindle Device vs. iBooks and iPad<br />--------------------------------------<br />- The iPad is so gorgeous a device. It allows you to do so many things with it, that I suspect others, like I did, fiddling and getting distracted with the device than actual reading, which may well take a backseat.<br /><br />- The temptation to multi-task when reading on the iPad is simply be too great.<br /><br />- The Kindle device lets you read; the iPad is more suited to surfing.<br /><br />- I miss touch gestures on the Kindle. I would like to use my finger to tap on a specific location on the page to start highlighting it, or to mark an annotation, etc... The navigation button is not as convenient.<br /><br />- Page flipping and reading:<br />-- The iPad is most certainly heavier than the Kindle.<br />-- You absolutely cannot expect to read a book by holding the iPad in your hand for any length of time.<br />-- You cannot hold the iPad in one hand and maneuver your fingers to flip or swipe to the next page. Just won't work.<br />-- The weight of the iPad and the slipperiness of the glass screen will cause the device to slip through and clanker to the floor. Goodbye iPad.<br />-- With the Kindle, holding it in one hand and flipping to the next or previous page is very, very easy.<br />-- Because the Kindle is light enough for you to do this, and secondly because the next and back buttons are very conveniently placed close to where you hand and fingers would be when reading, and thirdly because the matte finish of the device means it won't suddenly slide and slip from your grip.<br /><br />- Reading strain: the e-ink technology on the Kindle makes for a very, very stress free"

The book as a whole did that to a lesser degree. It goes off on long, boring tangents about science and technology that I did not enjoy very much. In fact, because I do much of my Kindle reading at bedtime, the start of one of those tangents was a cue to me that it was time to close the Kindle and go to sleep.<br /><br />If you are interested in time travel, science fiction themes, multiple timelines and such, you may very much enjoy this book.

These are usually long on snap and short of judgment.<br /><br />There is a high degree of dishonesty in our current society.  This is largely due to the fact there is no safe place to be honest.  In your family or work life, where is it safe to be honest?<br /><br />We all know about the devil's advocate.  Why not become an angel advocate.  Instead of being negative, shooting down ideas, offer support and encouragement.<br /><br />The future is already here, it is just not evenly distributed.<br /><br />If you are looking to improve your leadership skills this is a great place to start.  One of the themes repeated throughout the program is that great leadership starts within.  You must work on yourself first.<br /><br />Erica Ariel Fox made a profound observation during her interview.  She said you cannot learn a subject by reading books on it, attending a seminar or workshop.  To learn you must do.  You can learn ABOUT leadership from this program.

649214,2827765,"sample was good enough to make me buy the book. It was powerful and written with restraint. I was optimistic that I had found a good read. That, it turns out, was a mistake. I cut my losses, bailed out at 25% and returned the book. Why?<br /><br />Because after the first scene, the story lacks conflict. It consists of a very long flashback where the protagonist describes her life at seven years old. These reminiscences are narrated in a way that never makes it clear whether they are being told in the mature voice of the adult, or the immature, intolerably cute voice of the 7 year old. The diction, reasoning and vocabulary are mixed, leaving the reader feeling confused and manipulated by a writer obviously trying to portray a child as cute and innocent while forgetting that it is supposedly the older version of herself narrating. If this doesn't bother you, then this book may be for you, but for a literary novel, this is a stylistic faux pas of the highest order.<br /><br />And I'm not sure how he did it, but he managed to make introducing the first conscious android a dead bore--not an easy feat.<br /><br />Another thing that rang false, was the scene where a 7 and 8 year old male and female sleep together nude and the male comments that she makes a cuddly teddy bear. Might make sense to you, but to me it rang false.<br /><br />It's painfully obvious that this author is shooting for intellectual, literary readers. While his writing was certainly slow moving and lacking in conflict--two requirements of literary fiction to be sure--I wasn't impressed with the quality or freshness of the prose.<br /><br />Now, perhaps the book picked up later in the story and became superb as the review"

Also offers advise on the application in general. I've purchased another good book by a different author but this one has more essays.

This product is made with just two ingredients -- macadamias and cashews -- and I can say that this product demonstrates what a healthy, good for you food should taste like.<br /><br />Unlike Cacao Bliss, which is a solid product at room temperature, the macadamia cashew butter is easily retrieved from the container.  There was some oil separation but after a little stirring, one can take a butter knife and quickly spread the substance on a piece of toast or apple slices; the product is incredibly smooth out of the jar.  When looking at the butter, you will see little pieces of nuts which makes this product product have some texture.  This macadamia cashew butter is not as chunky as most chunky peanut butters; the chunks in this product are much finer.  I found the flavor to be very much influenced by the raw cashews and actually considered my jar to be more of a cashew butter than a macadamia butter.<br /><br />It is recommended that this product be refrigerated for a longer life.<br /><br />While not noted explicitly on the product's label, I could see nothing that would contradict my belief that this is a vegan product.  There is no milk, honey, eggs or other animal-based substances that go into the formulation of this product.

I took over 900 images with this lens and could find very little performance issues throughout the entire focal range. Of course, as with any lens, stopping down increases sharpness.  However, sharpness at 2.8 is superb, with the expected minor softness in extreme corners- though barely discernible in my sample, and better (IMHO) when compared to the Nikon 10-24.  Light falloff is minimal in real world applications.  But I am sure if I took a picture of a white wall, I could dissect the results until blue in the face, yet no one would ever notice it in a real photo.<br /><br />Distortion on this lens is as expected- typical, yet reasonable.  It is easily corrected in Nikon Capture NX2, Lightoom 3 or 4, and Photoshop CS5 or CS6.  Chromatic aberration is apparent with this lens, as in many other Ultra-Wide Angle lenses.  It is easily corrected in post processing as well.  General lens IQ is very good at all apertures and focal ranges.  AF is quick and accurate when paired with a Nikon D300s.

In this case, the [[ASIN:B006VDZE06 Allegro Winter 2012 Sampler]] proves itself to be an extraordinary offering for those wanting a winter interlude, and within are a few surprises and real gems.<br /><br />This album has the following tracks:<br /><br />1.

Porter is a Grammy-nominated jazz vocalist for his 2010 release, \\""Water,\\"" and this former San Diego State linebacker turned vocalist was a member of the original Broadway cast of \\""It Ain't Nothin' But the Blues.\\""  Last summer, Nate Chinen New York Times music critic Nate Chinen said of Porter, \\""His sturdy baritone and sure projection make him a natural belter, but he knows how to sidle up to a melody, working quietly with tension and release,\\"" and in that I heartily agree.  This track is from his forthcoming album [[ASIN:B006LMMN8I Be Good]], which will be available in February 2012.  If you needed any justification to download this album this song is it, and don't be surprised if he doesn't get another Grammy nod with this one.<br /><br />Matuto's \\""Dream of Life,\\"" the 2nd track is eclectic, to say the least.  Imagine if you will the sound of a Brazilian Carnaval celebration stuck somewhere in the Appalachian Mountains.  Matuto (\\""bumpkin\\"" in Brazilian slang) moves with two-stepping grace between bluegrass and forro, between swamp rock and maracatu, between surf guitar shimmies and the wah-wah of the berimbau.  I laughed the first time, but it grew on me by the second.<br /><br />In the third track, Susan Egan offers us another vocal gem with \\""Nina Doesn't Care.\\""  Susan Egan has traversed all four corners of the entertainment industry, making powerful impressions in theatre, film, television and music. She headlined on Broadway as \\""Thoroughly Modern Millie,\\"" won critical acclaim as Sally Bowles in \\""Cabaret,\\"" starred in \\""Triumph of Love\\"" and \\""State Fair,\\"" and received Tony Award and Drama Desk nominations for Best Actress as the original Belle in Disney's \\""Beauty and the Beast.\\""  It's another track that makes this sampler worth it, and made me add her album [[ASIN:B005AQQAL2 So Far]] to my wish list.<br /><br />The 4th track is \\""The Hole in the Map,\\"" and is performed by accomplished singer, lyricist, and songwriter Lorraine Feather.  Her new album [[ASIN:B006RY5EGS Tales of the Unusual]] will be released in February, and her song \\""The Hole in the Map\\"" is about explorer Percy Fawcett's Amazonian obsession and his disappearance in 1925.  Lorraine's recordings have received glowing review"

670207,73636,"sample of your speech so that it learns what your voice sounds like and your way of pronouncing different words. To input your speech, you will need to utilize a USB or Bluetooth microphone, your Mac’s internal mike  or by using an IOS/Android device using the Dragon Remote Microphone app. For my tests, I utilized the USB microphone VOIP headset with mic that I had on hand.<br /><br />Setting up Dragon Dictate was not hard, nor was it long and cumbersome. I immediately noticed that it was a lot faster then the previous version, v 2, that I had used. Once I plugged in the USB microphone and selected it, I just followed the directions on installing the downloaded version.  I registered the software as required (more on that later) and followed the instructions on using the microphone. I began creating my voice profile. The Voice Profile itself only took me several minutes to read through the paragraph as provided by the software, providing a sound level and voice training for the system to utilize. As you are reading and the system is learning, the words you have read will then turn green in the dialog box. If you follow the directions, read the paragraph to include punctuation, you should be up and running in short order. Since I am the primary user, my profile was all that I needed.  If other members of your household want to utilize Dragon Dictate after you’ve installed it and created your profile, they too would need to create a profile. I was also able, as the only user, to install Dragon Dictate on my Macbook Pro and copy my initial voice profile over to the Macbook and begin to utilize the software immediately.<br /><br />The thing that really makes Dragon Dictate a great product to work with is the ability to verbalize the command to “open” an application. A good example is the ability while using Dragon Dictate to speak “Open Mail” and Apple’s Mail application opens. Nuance has also updated the software to work more closely with Gmail. You can then speak “Click Compose” and a new message opens, which you can then follow up by speaking your text and end by telling Dragon Dictate to Send Message. I found it much more efficient to say “Open Links” select the numbered link that I wanted and say “Choose link 42” for example to compose and email.  Understand that you will still have to work with the system as Dragon Dictate does not understand a pause within a sentence so you would have to say “comma”, “semi-colon” or at the end of the sentence say “period.” There are still those times that you will still have to work with your hands to move a cursor to where you want it or to open an application, but overall the ability to utilize speech is an absolute pleasure. There were very few apps that I could not open by speaking “Open XXXX.” The ability to utilize both the application on the Mac and the IOS version, just in case an idea pops into your mind while on the road or not at your desk, makes working on a project or sending an email so much easier.<br /><br />Dragon Dictate has added a transcription feature, which, if you are the one making notes using a smartphone or a digital audio recorder, will make your life a heck of a lot easier. What you wind up doing is setting up a new profile for transcription in addition to the one you’ve already created for yourself. Now working with my iPhone, I recorded dictation for the required 90 seconds for training purposes and using Dragon Dictate, it asked if I wanted to open it, I did, and a transcription of what I had read appeared in a dialog box, sans punctuation. Now I sat there and clicked within the text and that area became highlighted and I could either accept it or ignore it. When you do find errors, you just type in the text box and change the text. This also helps train Dragon Dictate to properly handle your transcriptions.<br /><br />Now I downloaded a My Mac podcast (TechFan 160 as a MP3 file) and because there is music within the opening of the podcast, it was immediately clear that  I would need to make quite a few changes to the text. The other thing that you immediately  notice is that there is no punctuation so you will have to go in and make the necessary tweaks to make it more readable but it does make it easier for the most part than having to sit and type everything.  Of course, having Tim Robertson speak in his normal rate of speech caused a few more corrections to be done. The image below is what originally appeared when I imported it into Dragon Dictate.<br /><br />Transcription MyMac PodcastI then downloaded an audio clip where the speaker was taking their time, basically reading a prepared speech and there were only a couple of corrections needed. Now before everyone thinks that they can use Dragon Dictate in an environment where there are multiple speakers, that is not going to happen, at least not right now. If Nuance continues to work on and improve Dragon Dictate, that may come to pass.<br /><br />The more I used Dragon Dictate 4, the more I like it. I was really amazed that there was very few items that caused me any issues other than the fact that when I decided to try out different microphones to assess the flexibility of the program, I did run into a bit of a problem. I thought I would update and purchase a new headset, a Logitech H390, thinking that per information on websites that it was being used by PC users with dictation software it would be fine. I was wrong on that point. It would not work for audio input with Dragon Dictate on either my 2011 Mac Mini or my late 2012 MacBook Pro, both running 10.9.2. I finally settled on using that VOIP USB headset that works perfectly on both units. I did return the Logitech headset. The Nuance website that lists compatible headsets for use with Dragon Dictate is in need of updating as quite a few of the listed items are no longer available and some of the items are by companies that I’ve not heard of before.<br /><br />Is the program 100% accurate all of the time? Honestly, no. There are items that Dragon Dictate does have issues with when you are speaking. I would say treats and got traits; I finally figured out I just needed to take my time and once Dragon Dictate became used to me, the mistakes lessened. It’s a learning process for both the user and for the program. If you speak in a normal tone and at a speed that isn’t too fast, you should do quite well with the program. The one thing that remained the same from version 2 for me was that I was not able to get Dragon Dictate to properly spell my last name when I dictate something and include my name. I’ve followed every recommendation/tip that I could find on how to take care of this; nothing worked. I was finally provided guidance that because of the name, to get Dragon Dictate to properly spell it, I had to train Dragon in a different way than what I had been doing. Rather then Walkowich, I trained Dragon by adding vocabulary and breaking my name down to “Walk a witch” and combined with the proper spelling of my name, Dragon finally got it correct.<br /><br />Two things I did learn in using Dragon Dictate is first, you cannot dictate in the address box of Safari or Firefox. Nuance does intend to correct this issue, no time frame given as to when exactly this will occur. Second, if you have “ClickToPlugin” installed, make sure that when you install Dragon Dictate that you open up the ClickToPlugin extension, click the checkbox to access the settings and make sure that under Plugins, you check the box for the Dragon Dictate Internet Plug-In otherwise Dragon Dictate will not work.<br /><br />Nuance does provide a web page with information on Dragon Dictate for Mac, that includes a User Manual, demo videos and other information and links. If you have questions or need further information on how to use the application, take the time to check this out. You can also find instructional videos on YouTube on learning Dragon Dictate.<br /><br />My recommendation for those who may have issues with typing, medical or otherwise, or for someone who does do a lot of typing, is to consider the purchase of Dragon Dictate. The ability to sit at your computer and dictate a document, an email or whatever it is that you wish to do, is a tool really worth considering.<br /><br />There were a couple of questions that I had in regards to Dragon Dictate that I asked Nuance to respond to if they would. First, why the price disparity between Mac users and Windows/PC users? The Mac price – $180, the Windows/PC price – ranges between $50 and $120, based on the version and where it is purchased.<br /><br />The response from Nuance was:<br /><br />Dragon Dictate for Mac, version 4, and Dragon NaturallySpeaking Premium have the same list price of $199. Although they may have slight differences in features due to the different platforms that they run on, they both target the mainstream user. Both Nuance and retailers will often offer sales on Dragon products. Dragon NaturallySpeaking, having a larger user base, does offer a wider selection of versions than Dragon Dictate, with the features and capabilities differing with each version (hence the different price options).<br /><br />The second question was “With the customer/user becoming more aware of their own privacy when dealing with the Internet and companies, the question arises in regards to Nuance’s privacy policy and its use of customer data. Basically the user is signing away any privacy rights of their own data when they are registering Dragon Dictate. What is Nuance’s response to those who may be wary of allowing this access and what systems does Nuance have in place to protect the users information? (particularly in light of the hacking of major companies “secure” systems and the theft of customer information). I asked this question because of Nuance’s Website or Product Usage blurb when you are registering Dragon Dictate as shown below.<br /><br />Website or Product Usage<br /><br />Nuance responded back:<br /><br />Nuance takes its users’ privacy very seriously. The primary purpose for collecting user information is assessing the use cases of our products, in the interest of improving our core technology and the individual user experience. The information that people provide as part of their ongoing use of Nuance’s Dragon desktop products furthers the technology’s capability to understand and adapt to a person’s unique voice, allowing for a more personalized and effective experience with the product.<br /><br />Two questions that you need to ask yourself if you are considering purchasing Dragon Dictate for Mac 4. Is the pricing something you can afford and are you comfortable with Nuance having access to your information? The final decision on whether or not to utilize Dragon Dictate is up to you, the consumer. If you are comfortable with both, then enjoy Dragon Dictate.<br /><br />System Requirements-<br /><br />Intel based Mac computer (Minimum 2.4 GHzCore 2 Duo, Intel Core i3, i5 or i7)<br /><br />Mac OS 10.8.3 Mountain Lion or 10.9 Mavericks<br /><br />4 GB of RAM 4 GB of free"

675486,3283789,"sample the latest speakers by Acoustic Research, which revolutionized the industry in the early '60s by demonstraing the extraordinary bass-reproducing capabilities of hermetically-sealed, low-efficiency speakers--space-saving bookshelf speakers that justified an investment in the high-wattage amplifiers required to make them sound at their best.  KLH and Advent speakers soon followed in the same tradition while, today, it is the Tivoli brand that is the direct descendent of the original speakers designed by Henry Kloss.  Meanwhile, the West Coast was producing big high-efficiency speakers consisting of woofer, mid-range horns, and tweeters.  But gradually the company with the longest history--JBL In 2002 Apple's iPod changed people's listening habits, leading to the rise of many full-fidelity, down-siaced versions of the professional headphones warn by radio announcers.  Popular headphones that could be folded and carried in a pocket initially dominated the market--and some, like the Sennheiser 100's and the Koss Port-a-Pros still enjoy brisk sales.  But gradually it dawned on headphone makers as well as consumers that a tiny device placed in, or flush with, the ear canal need not be disadvantaged compared to the heavy behemoths.<br /><br />It took me a few years to accept (grudingly) the miniaturization of headphones (I'm one of thoose radio announcers who has become accustomed to professional-grade studio phones and admittedly a number of tiny earphones still sound like Crackerjack toys, especially in producing the sounds of the symphony orchestra or the thunder and brilliance of a Bosendorfer piano (my personal preference, though I would never walk away from a Steinway).  It wasn't until 2010, when my wife gifted me with Sony's best earphones (MDR-EX700LP), that I became a convert. I still dislike the feeling of using them for more practical purposes--like Skype conversations or even cell phone calls.  But for listening to Miles Davis or Bill Evans (but not on Impulse or Verve) or Jessica Williams these small phones are capable of serenading you all day long with wholly accurate and believable music that never wears out its welcome.<br /><br />The problem is that \\""earphones\\"" tend to become lost or broken a lot faster than a pair of large headphones.  Therefore, for regular, daily use you need a pair of good earphones that you can \\""afford\\"" to lose.  Of late I've been testing"

Douglas Anthony Cooper is a writer originally from Canada, who lived for a while in New York City but now lives in Mexico.  He has written three books.  His first book Amnesia was \\""postmodern architectural fiction\\"" according to Wikipedia.  The second book was Delirium and deals with the problems of narrative and a person's will to control their own story.  It was also the first novel to be fully serialized on the web.  While these seem somewhat interesting (the author has a MA in philosophy and studied architecture); it has almost nothing to do with Milrose Munce.<br /><br />Milrose Munce and the Den of Professional Help (only available on kindle in the US right now, paperback available in Canada and the UK) is about a teen that speaks to ghosts and the \\""Professional Help\\"" that tries to \\""solve his problem\\"".  This is a very advanced young adult book.  Not that the reading level is really high (I would guess advanced 10 year olds to about 15 should be interested in it) but that like the Lemony Snickett books, that is a dark, funny book that consciously tries to not speak down to the reader.<br /><br />Milrose is seen speaking to ghosts, which of course no one else can see, and he is recommended for \\""Professional Help\\"".  A second student, Arabella, which becomes a partner and romantic interest, is also in the same \\""Professional Help\\"" sessions.<br /><br />I do not want to give away too much of the story, but it is the tone and humor, more than the story line that I really like.  It is not that it was a bad story line, I liked the story.  But the tone and humor were what I was really drawn to.<br /><br />The author has the electronic right to the book in the US, but not the paper rights.  Doubleday has the paper rights, but has not chosen to publish the book in paper.  So Cooper released the book on his own through Amazon Kindle.  The price bounced from a penny to $1.99 for quite a while and the book completely disappeared several times because Doubleday kept asserting that they owned the electronic rights as well.  That seems to have been cleared up now and the price has stabilized at $1.99.  But it looks like on Tuesday (June 22) a completely re-written and expanded version of the book was released.

685769,1661118,"sample a number of recordings of the Brahms violin concerto in anticipation of an upcoming live performance and I realized I hadn't given this one a thorough listening.  I had become a bit disenchanted with Igor Oistrakh.  His recording of the Tchaikovsky Concerto with David Oistrakh conducting the Moscow Philharmonic was my all-time favorite recording of that piece but I later listened to Igor's recording of the Brahms Violin Sonatas and it didn't stand up to the stiff competition in the field.  I wondered if I had been misled.  Maybe I unconsciously imbued his performance of the Tchaikovsky concerto with misplaced romantic feelings  -- a young violinist is accompanied by a famous orchestra conducted by the violinist's father who also happens to be one of the greatest violinists of all time.  It's easy to imagine hearing in this recording both Igor's striving to please and impress his father and David's pride and support for his son's accomplishments.  Sometimes these extra-musical elements add to the beauty of a recording and make more of it than what it would be otherwise.  Guarding against that tendency, I initially set myself somewhat critically against this recording.<br /><br />To my surprise and delight, Oistrakh won me over again, and this time in a big way.  We all become accustomed to listening for certain special moments that occur in our favorite recordings and if we don't find those same magical moments in another recording we tend to discount the other recording.  One must make a concerted effort to avoid that habit in order to really listen and consider a new recording.  Having gotten past some of the moments culled from other recordings, I could begin to hear what beauty Igor brings.  I'm not a violinist -- and I believe that violinists are better able to assess his ability more critically and accurately -- but _no one_ in my experience plays as expressively as Igor Oistrakh does.  His technique might not be up to the level of some of the more well-known great violinists, but he can infuse some otherwise unremarkable passagework -- and even individual notes -- with the most intense expression.  For example, if you have the score handy, take a look at the \\""tranquillo\\"" section also marked \\""leggiero ma espressivo (grazioso)\\"".  It occurs a little more than 300 measures into the first movement, right after the second \\""Tutti\\"" (the first \\""Tutti\\"" is the beginning of the piece just before the violinist's magnificent entrance at about measure 90).  This passage is relatively unremarkable and most violinists play it that way.  It consists of twenty measures of a pattern of repeated sequences of an eighth note plus two sixteenths -- three of these for each measure (bum ba-da bum ba-da bum ba-da....).  In this recording it occurs at the 10:45 minute mark.  Most of the time I briefly tune out passages like these because they seem transitional.  They seem intent on just getting the music to the next big moment.  I think lesser violinists tend to play _past_ these kinds of passages as they anticipate what's coming next.  But this is not true of Igor Oistrakh.  For the first time, I really heard this passage through this recording.  This is only one small example, but this recording is characterized by this kind of expressive playing throughout.  He completely pulls me in.  Maybe it's his deft and tasteful use of portamento -- a practice that seems to have grown out of style.  One doesn't hear that same practice among younger artists, and I miss it.  I think they sound almost sterile by comparison.<br /><br />My collection of Brahms violin concerto recordings also includes Joshua Bell, Christian Ferras, Hilary Hahn, Jascha Heifetz, Nigel Kennedy, Leonid Kogan, Gidon Kremer, Tasmin Little (review"

695985,3381446,"sample of the sound you selected or maybe I didn't know how to play it.<br /><br />Other Internet Apps<br />-------------------<br />Normally, the Squeezebox will display the logo of the station you are playing or, if you are listening to a service such as Pandora, you will see the album cover the song came from. But if you install the Flickr App, you can display your Flickr pics instead. It's pretty cool but it wears off quite quickly. The color screen is nice and bright but it's also small and I get a radio because I want to listen to it, not to stare at a 2-inch screen. Again, it's nice but I wouldn't miss this capability if it wasn't available.<br /><br />There are other innovative apps that may have some limited use. The Amazon app for example, will allow you to buy your favorite music directly from the Squeezebox (wow!!!). The Facebook app will, according to the Logitech site, allow you to share your favorite music with family and friends, discover new friends with similar music interests or communicate with friends away from your computer. I didn't try it yet.<br /><br />More Features<br />-------------<br />As if this wasn't enough, the Squeezebox also allows you to stream music off your home computers after you install the Squeezebox Server on it - supports Windows (Vista/XP/2000), Mac, Ubuntu, Linux. Again, a nice thing to have but I simply can't see why I would want to stream music to a device equipped with a small, mono speaker. I'd rather listen to music off my laptop since it comes out in stereo there. I suspect it works well but I didn't think it was worth trying.<br /><br />The Squeezebox also allows to connect and play an iPod or some other MP3 player - cable provided. And, again, it's good to have this but piping iPod music through a little mono speaker... not worth it.<br /><br />Finally, you can listen to the Squeezebox with headphones. It's nice you can but I don't think too many users would care about this capability.<br /><br />MY EXPERIENCE<br /><br />I find the Squeezebox to be an extraordinarily great Internet Radio device. Or rather, an Alarm Clock/Internet Radio. While limited by the small, single speaker to 'mono' sound, the quality of the output is quite impressive. I suspect there's a large cache built in because, when listening to the same Pandora output on my computer and on the Squeeze, the Squeeze came pretty close to crystal-clear while my computer's output was below par.<br /><br />It's impossible to say how many stations can be tuned to but the number should be in the thousands. It's not always easy to find what you are looking for but quick and dirty searches are possible by simply entering the station's call letters or you can go geographically by continent/country/city/genre.<br /><br />Some of the available Apps are fun to use - something like Pandora's customized radio stations should be close to one's dream of music listening. Other apps can go in the 'wow' category as in \\""I can't believe they can do this\\"" but aren't likely to be used much. The beauty of the Apps concept is that the Squeezebox is infinitely expandable as more Apps doing things we can't imagine today can be added when available.<br /><br />What impressed most about the Squeezebox were:<br /><br />- extraordinary easy and quick setup on a Wi-Fi network<br />- the sheer volume of Internet radio stations available<br />- the availability of great Apps such as Pandora<br />- the Alarm/Clock function<br />- the color screen that displays interesting information such as album covers or stations logos and the name of the artists playing<br />- infinite expandability through new Apps<br /><br />Some of the shortcomings include:<br /><br />- ONLY 6 preset station buttons<br />- mono sound<br />- a simple remote control would make operation easier<br />- there's no information in the broadcast quality (kbps) displayed anywhere or rating the station based on the quality of their broadcast<br />- it's possible to get lost into some of the enormous menu trees<br />- completely dependent on Logitech for service - nothing other than maybe streaming music from one's own computer would work if Logitech went out of business or stopped supporting the Squeezebox.<br /><br />MY RATING<br /><br />I really, really love this device and Amazon's rating for \\""I love it\\"" is 5 stars. Clearly, it's not perfect but, for the price, this is close to the best one can get when it comes to the ability to listen to distant radio stations without involving a computer.<br /><br />All we hear is Radio Ga Ga<br />Radio Blah Blah<br />Radio what's new?<br />Someone still loves you!<br /><br />_______________________________________<br /><br />Note:<br /><br />Please see the first comment to this review"
696289,3081967,"sample it. Upon first hearing this release, I thought the release was a crossfader smashing excursion into ripped samples and overdubs, but after seeing short clips of the group rip it up live with instrumentation (and a bit of sampling), I'm fully convinced (not that I would have been any less impressed had they done it the other way around). The album wastes no time getting rolling, as the opener of \\""Panther Dash\\"" busts out of the gate with a 70s TV theme-show drum rumpus as a harmonica and guitar team up for a good natured showdown.<br /><br />From there, the listener is hardly able to catch a breath as \\""Ladyflash\\"" again busts loose with weird vocals and flutes that almost sound like Bollywood (chants of \\""We're here to rock the microphone\\"" included) while \\""Junior Kickstart\\"" sounds like a hyper-saturated theme containing bits from every cool car-chase sequence or Warriors-style throwdown lead-in done in the past 20 years. It doesn't really matter that half the time you can't make out the lyrics and the other half they're simply chants to \\""rock\\"" or countdowns to bring that beat back because the group flys by the seats of their pants with such reckless abandon that it's hard not to get caught up by it all.<br /><br />So yes, the group might be fluffy, and while they call to mind all the references mentioned above and then some, they do it in a way that makes it all sound fresh and fun again. Hearing Thunder, Lightning, Strike for the first time will probably give you sorta the same feeling you had when you first heard When I Left You by The Avalanches. You know you've heard the parts before, but you've never quite heard them put together in a way that the group has done it, and for that they put a grin on your face and a little bit of shuffle in your step. Easily one of the most fun releases of the year. If this thing ever gets better distribution, all Top 40 pop tartlets best watch their backs, because I have a feeling The Go!

Reprised from will.i.am's [[ASIN:B00BCV3HGU #Willpower]], the cut makes more contextual sense on a soundtrack, but still ends up being too manic and, well dumb.  Will.i.am loves to `go stupid' though.<br /><br />Fergie, Q-Tip, and Goonrock combine for another mixed-emotions cut in \\""A Little Party Never Killed Nobody (All We Got)\\"".  On the one hand, the energy is superb and even the production.  On the other hand, it is only a notch less `stupid' than \\""Bang Bang\\"".  Lana Del Rey atones by being true to herself on \\""Young and Beautiful\\"", the touted representative single.  It is solid, but with reservation; like some of Del Rey's own music, it is a bit indulgent and boring.  Not bad though, if somewhat safe.  \\""Love Is the Drug\\"" follows, performed by Bryan Ferry and the Bryan Ferry Orchestra.  While it avoids the gimmickry of the will.i.am and Fergie, et al cuts, it also underwhelms, particularly from the production end - never quite gels to the ears.<br /><br />Florence + The Machine seems the apparent savior of the effort, but \\""Over The Love\\"" pales when place up against \\""Shake It Out\\"" or \\""Only If For The Night\\"" from her latest studio album. Pieces are in place, but the finesse falls short. \\""Where The Wind Blows\\"" featuring Coco O. Isn't too shabby, sampling Sophie Tucker and adding some modern flare with the drum programming.  Emeli Sand&eacute; channels her `inner-Beyonc&eacute;' on a cover of \\""Crazy in Love\\"" with the Bryan Ferry Orchestra.  She doesn't achieve the same swagger (few could), but it's solid.<br /><br />Alternative rock takes over the soundtrack following Sand&eacute;'s cut.  \\""Together\\"" gives The xx a solid moment that's mysterious and conveys an interesting vibe.  \\""Hearts A Mess\\"" is a nice contribution from Gotye's 2006 effort [[ASIN:B001MFSVXU Like Drawing Blood]], which received proper release just recently.  \\""Love is Blindness\\"" finds Jack White shocking with a gritty take on U2's \\""Love Is Blindness\\"".  Nero is the first hiccup in the momentum as \\""Into The Past\\"" has plenty of attributes, but the track ends up a bit of a bore.

Her friend and next-door neighbor provides both lodging and employment when she moves into the cottage on his property and begins working for him as a deputy coroner.

The deeper scratches and nicks in the plastic from road debris that I hadn't sanded down were still visible, but other than that the lenses were clear.

How long will it be before I'm back to cruddy looking lenses?  Dunno honestly, but I'd take a guess at a year or two.

704210,935658,"sample prints, examined them under a loupe, and I must say they were great. I was impressed with the quality.    Everything seems to run smoothly for the first week or so, although I noticed that the printer had a tendency to perform prolonged nozzle cleaning sessions. One session lasted between 6 and 7 minutes. That's when I started to look at the ink levels charts. This printer is really using the ink I thought. I then noticed large random dots, about 3mm in diameter on some of my prints, sometimes only an hour after a new start-up nozzle cleaning session. My last printing endeavor on this printer - just following a nozzle cleaning session - were eight 4x4\\"" images where these dots showed up on five prints, some were in the margins and some right on the image itself.    Calling Epson was quite an experience. The person told me to simply do a nozzle clean. I told him I had just done nozzle cleans, but he insisted and I did it. The first print out had the famous 3mm dots on the paper and the print. Do the nozzle clean again, he said. At this point I confronted him with the question of how much ink a nozzle clean required because my ink indicators showed a decrease in ink level of about 15% with each cleaning. He had no answer to that, or to any of my other questions, including the amber light question.    I was now out of ink and had a lot of unwanted dots on many of the prints I had made. At this point I knew I would never feel comfortable using a set of inks priced at about $125. and only wind up with a handful of usable images.

706144,2149293,"Sample). HTC's recorded video sound is quiet, choppy & staccato. Both devices have their pluses and minuses, but this is where the line in the sand is drawn. The GS2's playback on recorded videos is excellent.<br /><br />IPHONE 4S vs GS2<br />The iPhone isn't really in the same league. It's an incredible device, but it's just an app tray - squares on a (small) screen. As a result, iPhones are a little more consistent. The Apple is a bit smoother because it doesn't have to do much more than launch apps. You wouldn't expect a multi-functional Range Rover SUV to be as smooth as a Lexus sedan. You also wouldn't expect a Lexus to do as much as a Range Rover.<br /><br />iPhones have no widgets, no multiple homescreens, (still) no full flash browser, no customization, no memory card, no removable battery, no keyboard options, no homescreen replacements, smaller screen... You get the idea. With Android, if you don't like the gallery, keyboard, browser, camera functions, messaging, icons, screen transitions... download new ones. iPhone is mostly closed. iPhones don't do much more than host/open apps. They're well-designed, user-friendly & have wonderful cameras, but they're tract phones, can't really customize/alter them.<br /><br />iPhones don't have true multi-tasking. You can have a number of apps open at once on the iPhone, but the Galaxy SII allows me to continuously download a movie whilst listening to music & surfing the web - all at once. The GSII's dual-core processor does so w/o as much as a hiccup. I've been unable to exhaust the GSII.<br /><br />Another thing iPhones don't have is bloatware. The GS2 has plenty, unfortunately.<br /><br />However, if you're a busy career and/or family person, or not too good w/ technology, the iPhone is definitely better for you. No question. iPhones take less time to configure, learn & operate. They are more consistent. Everything works as it should out of the box.<br /><br />iPhones hold their value much better, if that matters to you. Reason being, Samsung, HTC, Motorola come out with new Android flagships nearly every month. Folks will only pay so much for a smartphone. The iPhone, by contrast, is Apple's standard for the year.<br /><br />If you're worried about apps, iPhone has many more, hands down, but Android offers most any app that you'd would want. Siri? Android already has Vlingo & Iris. They're no where near as accurate or robust, but I'd sooner call my friends than have a back/forth with a phone. Android Market also offers aDownloader which is a movie torrent. I was able to download 'The Hangover II' in HD in 45 mins & watch in on my HD tv... for free"

That being said, this was a minor, MINOR issue which can be &#34;band-aided&#34; with some duct tape.<br /><br />Looking on Amazon.com, there are many corn hole sets.  If you remove all the ones that have trademark logos on them, a standard price for a &#34;good set&#34; is around $150-$189 so having this product sold at $164.99 is right in the ballpark.  Clearly Viva Sol figured out that $239.99 was too expensive as there is only one other non-logo set that is sold for more than $189 and its $250 - which is WAY too expensive.  Overall I couldn't have been happier with the Viva Sol Premium Bean Bag Toss Game Set.  We have played on it every night since we got it and the whole family has commented on how nice it is.  Now if I could just improve my game so my wife doesn't beat me all the time, I'd be a happy man...all-wood construction, the sets together are not light.<br /><br />The only slight dig I have is that when I received the package, it was obvious that the set had been sitting around for a while as there was a noticeable layer of dust on everything.  In addition, there was a certain amount of plastic fatigue as one of the 12 brackets that holds the legs to the underside of the boards broke after I removed the legs the first time and the nobs that hold into place four of the eight &#34;feet&#34; on the metal legs had snapped off so I have to position these feet by hand every time I put the set together.

Put 24 of them together and they neatly fit into a 1.544 Mbps T1 circuit.  That's called toll quality voice.  AT&T gives you 1/8 or so of a 30 khz cellular voice channel  or about 3.8 kbps - but they have improved recently.  Verizon starts off with their EVRC or enhanced variable rate vocoder so you have no idea how many bits you are getting.  It changes the bits used based on speach but averages 6-8 kbps.  NOTE already we went from toll quality 56 kbps to<br />`4-6 kbps.  Ouch.  How'd they do that?  It's like a really lossy MP3.  REALLY LOSSY.  That's why digital cell phones sound so bad to begin with.  The process of getting from 56 to 6 kbps is called transcoding (trans=changing, coding - the code rate)  They need to change from the 56k standard toll quality voice to their over the air standard.<br /><br />But wait.  Bluetooth doesn't run EVRC or GSM or 12 Kbps fixed (an option if you hack the VOCODER in your phone to give you a tad bit more bandwidth at the expense of the cell co that I wont discuss) so it has to do another transcode to whatever bluetooth uses.<br /><br />Now we have a bad name for that - we call it talking double digital - you transcoded from a wireline to cellular and transcoded again to bluetooth.  Double digital.  It's double the artifacts of digital making it sound worse not better.<br /><br />Wanna get even worse?<br /><br />Speak into bluetooth and transcode to your cell company - call some person on another cell company (android calls iphone good example) and both people use speakerphones - top of the line ones.<br /><br />How many transcodes?<br /><br />speach speakerphone (code bt) android (5kbps) -> 56K voice on T1 -> gsm 4.8 kbps - >bluetooth again -> speaker phone<br /><br />Thats one, two, three, four, five transcodes for only two people talking - and you wonder why it is not understandable on the other end?<br /><br />If two people had called from a desk set and a telephone number to another desk set and phone number there would be zero lossy compresssion and zero transcoding (assuming no cordless phones) and the persons on each end would have one syncrhnized (via gps) clock at 56 kpbs between them - ONLY ONE CODING and zero transcoding - and it sounds  way way better than the voice band (which is the cell co's secret to make voice compressable - like a really bad mp3 at 6 kbps when you are accustomed to 320 kbps mp3s)<br /><br />it's a matter of saving bandwidth, power, and making room for all the users on the unlimited voice plans who dont have a landline phone any more in nyc, lax, sfc, to yack yack yack.<br /><br />Why did we get all the transcoding - digital phones.  Analog phones used 30 khz (30,000 hz or digitally 30 kbps) over the radio to send your voice to the tower.  By taking 30khz and giving you6 of it the cell co's get 5 conversaions into a single \\""channel\\"" (however various modulation methods aggregate all the channels into a big mushpile then decode the bits out of just one conversation using gps timing so they just look like a 10 Mhz block of noise (CDMA) - but its not always 10 Mhz given the new auctions.  We won't go there.  It gets real messy real quick.<br /><br />The good news is that it gets better.<br /><br />Lookin at audio as an example:<br /><br />128 kbps MP3 (nano) -> 44.1 Khz 16 bit (CD) -->  48/96 khz 24 bit (FLAC) studio mixdown master recording<br />(yech)  CD audio OK  FLAC audio just like being there<br /><br />FLAC stands for 3 important things<br />1 - FREE"

Be sure to read all of the ingredients before indulging, if you have G6PD deficiency, legume issues, or any other food sensitivity or allergy.<br /><br />-The flavors smell fantastic, during and after steeping, but the flavor is almost like a 1:10 soup diluted in water.<br /><br />-The flavors sound like delicious soups we adore, which I think skews the experience a bit. If you go into the experience without mentally connecting the flavors to their soup counterparts, you might be less disappointed.  This may be an issue for me alone, but I think more novel flavors, that don't automatically make one think of the soup versions, might have been a saving grace for Numi's Savory Teas.<br /><br />-It took me a moment to get my bearings as far as what I should add to the tea as I usually add splenda and half & half which would not be appropriate with a savory tea.  I added a pinch of sea salt and the flavor was greatly improved.  I started adding more seasonings from my cabinet and realized I was basically trying to recreate the sensory experience of soup.  Next time, I'll stop at the pinch of sea salt.<br /><br />-I do like the idea of Savory Tea, but the execution has me not as enthused.<br /><br />-I think these could be a perfect accouterment to actual soup from scratch.

I did not appreciate the rep's over-the-top theatrics when I told her I was using Neutrogena soap to wash my face at night. It's one thing to say, \\""X could be causing some of your irritation. Let me tell you about how soothing our cleanser is.\\"" It's something else to stumble backward with your hand over your mouth as though I had just confessed to having kidnapped the Lindhberg baby. Further, saying that my peeling and irritation is the result of the Neutrogena soap is an outright lie, especially considering she knew that I was using Tazorac. She also acted like she had never heard of Lauder's Advanced Night Repair. I find it difficult to believe that she had never heard of the product considering she is in the skincare industry. Also, when I got home I couldn't find any testimonials online about people using this after plastic surgery or peels, not even on their own website.<br /><br />As skeptical as I now was, I took the rep's actions as typical sales antics, and I went ahead with my purchase because the toner had been so soothing. When she spritzed my face at the store, I had on a layer of makeup, a layer of primer, another layer of moisturizer, and my customary afternoon layer of oil from my own skin. It felt so good that I never stopped to think about the barrier on my skin before I bought the products. Using them at home after removing the makeup, oil et cetera was a completely different experience. The cleanser did not even begin to remove makeup. When my skin was clean, and I sprayed on that toner, it might as well have been battery acid. I yelped and began fanning my face. Thinking my problem was the toner & possible alcohol, I used the night cream to get relief, but that only made it worse.<br /><br />I didn't know how to get the stuff off. My face felt like it was on fire at this point and everything was irritating it. The best I could do was rinse several times with cool water. I now have a 3 by 4 inch pink burn on the left side of my neck just beneath the jawline, and a 1 by 2 ½ inch pink burn on the top part of my right cheek. As a bonus, the cheek area was the exact area where I wanted to reduce redness. I know from experience that my skin will take 2 or 3 weeks to heal from this disaster. In the meantime I get to go to meetings with clients, corporate officers and attorneys (seeing the attorneys is related to my business, not this incident), and it's impossible to cover this with makeup and make it passable. Even more demoralizing is that I have all of this new makeup I've bought that I won't be able to use for a month because of this.<br /><br />Needless to say this is going back to Sephora when I go out tomorrow.

I began with:<br />-Frequencies Sounds of Healing by-Jonathan Goldman<br />and<br />-Deep Alpha: Brainwave Synchronization for Meditation and Healing by Steven Halpern (actually SEVERAL of his albums)<br /><br />  I played with these downloads using the Color Organ.<br /><br />  The result is that this is an item I may never fully master as far as creating my OWN &#34;experiences&#34; beyond using this oh so easy Color Organ feature with my own choice of music. But of all there is to experience, I found it beyond amazing that I can change virtually EVER single track included by simply using my finger while viewing (eyes closed) to toggle the joystick like center controller. As you &#34;toggle&#34; to all of the assorted choices it offers, the entire visual experience changes...It just seems to offer me more and more endless REALMS to visit, to escape to.  I am unsure if this device could ever be improved on, the more i use it?<br /><br />  One single track (or whatever they call it?) that mesmerizes ME is the:<br />---- Sessions/Audio Strobe/<br />---- and the &#34;track&#34; is titled Audio Illusions.mp3<br />This is all by itself, an escape for me, an honest journey that has so many moving parts (again, fr me anyway) that I simply get lost in it. MindPlace, IF you ever see this. PLEASE create more like this. I will demo this to others as I am able but for my particular situation (extreme physical pain, anxiety etc) it is like an escape pod to another existence altogether. Unlike most, I love talking politics cuz I hate ALL politicians, all parties equal:-) I see no use for their very existence other than to destroy all I worked my entire life to build. Now religion is another matter. I HATE to even use the word. Reason being is simple. I saw, felt, smelled, tasted and crawled through too much filth, horror, and nastiness in my life to ever believe in any God, any religion, any faith whatsoever. And I have travelled the world, sampled many...Don't get me wrong, I respect those who have any faith. I no longer envy them, but am happy they can believe in something that affords them a measure of peace.<br /><br />  The Kasina restores so much of all I have lost. I hate to go on & on since I feel it makes me sound like a shill, nutcase, or just a fanboy of sorts. I can only say I wish MindPlace had the resources to take their products to Military institutions, hospitals etc like HeartMath does, like Wild Divine does. That is how I found THEM, I have bought virtually every single piece of hardware and software they make. It is now going up on Craigslist as while it offers some measure of DISTRACTION from our darker side, it is only that. A mild distraction at best. The Kasina for me, once again is literally an escape pod. It can NOT be ignored, can not be bypassed by reality. If your reality is physical pain, distress, depression? Plug into a Kasina and I dare you to be able to even THINK about anything other than what you are seeing and hearing. I dare you....<br /><br />  I am a very strong willed person. Some may look at me, in a broken body, turning 65 years of age the end of this month. What they never see is the guy inside. THAT guy is still surfing 20 foot PLUS waves, winning surf contests, racing his motorcycles on the track both on and off road, setting speed records (for awhile anyway darn it), chasing girls till his wife (who can out surf most ANY man) caught his sneaky old self. They don't see the man who refused to surrender to pain, to a war that devoured his soul, to the broken and failing body that now houses his indomitable soul. They see this always smiling old phart (take THAT spelling censors!), they see a guy who is still making endless jokes and who just will NOT quit. I am not gullible, I worked for years for different police departments and generally don't trust much if anything at all. I am a skeptic, born of experience. But I am hoping against hope, that somehow, MindPlace can find some way to get this device into the hands of people like myself. I KNOW it cab change your world if it is like MY world. I probably shouldn't say more, it just sounds like a rambling commercial. But how do I get this message out to the many that could really be helped by it? For some it may be a toy, a &#34;trip&#34; machine (sorry I don't do drugs...), others maybe to just relax. But the Kasina is a device I doubt ANYONE could ignore, dismiss or even discount to any degree. I guess I am trying to say that after all I have survived, enjoyed, loved....the Kasina is MY religion now.  Like I said earlier, if a religion can bring a person peace, I respect it. MindPlace, if you ever see this, PLEASE create more like:<br />---- Sessions/Audio Strobe/<br />---- and the &#34;track&#34; is titled Audio Illusions.mp3<br />  I will do whatever I have to to afford whatever the cost for more like that. I owe you so much. I will share this device with every heartbeat I have left with those I know who can benefit from it,<br />Mike<br /><br />UPDATE Feb 23 2014:<br /><br />  I forgot to mention that I much prefer the earbuds that come with the Kasina over the VERY cheezy & uncomfortable headphones that were included with my old Nova Pro. But because those nasty headphones on the Nova Pro were so bad, and since that company recommended I buy Sony MDRV6 Monitor Series Headphones with CCAW Voice Coil, I did that and did NOT include them in the sale when I got rid of that device. I have to tell you that with these Sony MDRV6 Monitors on, this Kasina takes you OUT of whatever World you are in. The sound really nails the low end frequencies and ought to be recommended with all &#34;mind machines&#34; in my opinion. I really scored when I used the download app called Camelizer and then set up a notification by email f the price dropped to where I could afford it. Sure enough, soon afterwards I got an email alert that they plummeted to just thirty nine,dollars and 99 cents! Felt like I won the lotto!<br /><br />  The other thing is customer service. I have been online with MindPlace DAILY since buying my Kasina and Robert has either taken pity on me (smile)or just plain bent over backwards getting me very specific programs that help me the most with my pain management. I explained to him that I was sort of disappointed in my results using the Color Organ when I used it with my downloaded meditation music since I got mostly just very mild but pleasant shades of blues. He explained to my ignorant old self that it really requires &#34;beats&#34; to get  really optimal colors I need to &#34;escape&#34;. I thought about it and thought well, how do I RELAX if I listen to rock? Then it hit me and I tried something. Some music (for me anyway) can very much still relax me while having &#34;beats&#34; to the music. And for me, all my Mark Knopfler music, especially his new Privateer Deluxe 25 song MP3 album was just the ticket. It works for me because his music, his voice, his brilliant guitar work are often stories. therefor, a journey. So it works PERFECTLY for me to make that escape I need. His music often speaks of olden times and journeys, he even uses a different guitar for different songs as he feels the VOICE of each guitar is different and wants it to speak by itself to better express what he wants to convey.

By the end of the book, I wanted to read the second and third novels in the trilogy and felt that it wasn't very dark or disturbing.

Time definitely stopped while tasting this chocolate.<br /><br />Irr&eacute;sistible - Dark chocolate and Strawberry sauce.<br /><br />For ever - If you love coffee this may be one of the most delicious milk or dark chocolate chocolates ever made as it is filled with a special coffee cream that has hints of caramel. I ordered an entire box of these and they come in a variety of flavors. The milk chocolate and cherry filling is like Claude Debussy's Rêverie. It is difficult to describe besides saying it is like a delicate cherry icing wrapped in milk chocolate.<br /><br />Merveilleux - Milk or dark chocolate filled with coffee ganache.<br /><br />Europe - Dark or milk chocolate filled with rum filling.<br /><br />Ganache - Milk or dark chocolate with pure ganache.<br /><br />Tosca - Milk chocolate with a special ganache.<br /><br />Po&eacute;sie - Dark chocolate and a Cointreau filling.<br /><br />Antoinette - Delicate caramel hints in the milk chocolate coating mingle nicely with the vanilla filling.<br /><br />Eve - Milk or dark chocolate with a creamy dreamy banana filling.<br /><br />Alexandre le grand - A milk or dark chocolate with caramel cream.<br /><br />Also Recommended:<br /><br />If you wish to also try the Napolitains, I'd suggest the 1 pound sampler Ballotin with six varieties. You may also want to look for the new Palet d'Or. A deeply delicious and strong bitter chocolate filled with ganache. The center is made with butter, cream and chocolate and the outer coating is a masterpiece with gold decorations.<br /><br />Leonidas now has over 1700 stores and sales locations worldwide and they offer over 80 varieties of fresh chocolates. The chocolates are air freighted weekly from Brussels so you will always find the quality to be superior.<br /><br />My chocolates arrived fast and were as fresh as if I had purchased them in Belgium. They were carefully packaged in the famous gold boxes with signature/seasonal wrapping and a ribbon. The boxes were then placed in protective Styrofoam containers to protect the chocolates during shipping. The expedited shipping is recommended from May to early September.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"

It has become like an extra appendage--it goes with me everywhere, and most of the time, I barely notice it.  I was dismayed by my extremely low step totals during my first few days of use, but I've already started to make progress.  Although I do like the pedometer, there are definitely some features that could be better, so I have provided a detailed breakdown below.<br /><br />APPEARANCE:  The pedometer is a sleek little thing about the size of a flattened egg.  The edges are rounded, so I find it comfortable to hold in my pants pocket, although a bit smaller would certainly be nice.  The main step display is large an easy to read; there is a smaller time display as well.  I have never accidentally pushed the reset button, but I have accidentally pushed the mode button.<br /><br />CLIPS:  As other review"

757456,328552,"sample photo for this camera of the girl with red hair, you will have a very hard time finding out what is actually in focus and what is sharp.  That image on the Canon site is very fuzzy and not a great representation of what you can get with this camera.  From shots I've taken image sharpness is adequate but may vary based on individual unit within the same model.  My photos look fine but many of those from this model camera on flickr, amazon, and elsewhere on the Internet do not look that sharp.  There is a sharpness setting in my colors/custom that can boost the results.<br /><br />The largest IQ problem with this camera is that it tends to overexpose by 1/3 - 2/3 stop when used outdoors.  This might just be a problem with my copy but it does show up in a good percentage of photos.  Shooting outdoors would be the first thing I would check after getting this camera.  You can adjust through EV overrides and by trying out different scene modes.  But seriously this kind of problem should not be present in any modern P&S.<br /><br />Summary:  If you want a small very pocketable P&S, don't need a long zoom range, and can live without a viewfinder, this is one of the best picks at currently ~$150 as of this review"

768798,738844,"sample. It took some experience with the device to get it tightly closed: at first I didn't realize I needed to roll the top over several times before clipping it shut.  Getting the air out is not so easy--especially if you don't notice that you need to pinch the outside of the base of the valve while compressing the bag  to open the valve to release air. The picto-gram instructions didn't initially make things clear on those points. The idea of the scrubbing 'wash board' is not bad and the sloshing-rolling washing action is effective and even fun. With this kit and some low-suds liquid detergent, I feel secure that the water won't leak out of the sink while I'm trying to do a wash.  It also provides for a more thorough rinse cycle.  Once I 'got up to speed' on how to use this I had no trouble doing a 'load of two pairs of briefs and two sets of socks.  Doing hiking shorts or a couple of dress shirts or tees is fine but long pants use the wash space quickly.<br /><br />At $55. per copy it will be important for this bag and its valve to be durable long enough to become cost-effective.  Initially the fabric seems sturdy and the seams are well-sealed over a generous contact area.  The closure depends on some stitching to hold two heavy, somewhat flexible strips in place.  Those stitches appear to be well executed and even.  In the end, my star rating was influenced by price more than anything else.  I had more difficulty than many review"

769523,77666,"sample cards online from the Universal Fantasy Tarot, I was mesmerized. I loved the bold colors and unusual depictions--and felt confident that I would love this deck.<br /><br />So I pre-ordered it through Amazon.com and when I got it in my hands, I was *blown away* at the stunning artwork on this deck! Truly, I haven't seen anything like it. Aesthetically speaking, I believe it to be the most beautiful deck I've ever seen. And my husband, and artist, agrees! He's fawned over the Universal Fantasy Tarot ever since it came in the mail. He even went so far to say that he feels most--if not all--of the cards in this deck could be framed and hung with pride in our living room.<br /><br />I don't know about you, but when I hear the phrase \\""fantasy art\\"", I tend to think of the gaudy, revealing covers of sci-fi paperbacks--or the half-nude She-Ra's entwined around the legs of a dragon ala artists like Boris Vallejo. (And let me tell ya, that ain't my idea of good art...)<br /><br />So I was thrilled to discover that the Universal Fantasy Tarot features gorgeous jewel-tone hues, fantastical creatures, unusual elements (such as body armor comprised of a many-windowed castle!), and incredible detail work. Sumptuous, flowing garments swirl and cascade around bodies (the icy blue gown on the Queen of Swords is *amazing*!), and Martinello's re-interpretation of Tarot symbology is astounding.<br /><br />For example, a huge, elongated headdress crowns The Empress--but it's supported by what looks to be a steel pole. When I first saw this image, I thought the headdress looked like a stylized brain (trust me--it's not gruesome!)...and how the \\""brain\\"" and logic of The Emperor brings support and balance to the emotional subjectivity of The Empress.<br /><br />When I saw the 6 of Cups--which features a winged creature that looks rather like a feathered snail, with two children atop its shell...\\""fishing\\"" for a lost cup that fell in the water--I couldn't help but think \\""trying to retrieve something lost in the past\\"". And the 9 of cups? A yawning dragon-like creature (clad in what looks to be a smoking jacket!) seems to stumble out of a hangover fog while nine lamps burn inside golden cups. Has this party animal been burning the midnight oil in a drunken indulgence, perhaps?<br /><br />From the distressed Hanged Man suspended by a bird high above the Earth's atmosphere, to the elegant Knave of Chalices accompanied by an equally exotic companion (a floating, human-sized fish who breathes air!)--each dynamic image from the Universal Fantasy Tarot will draw you in, capture your imagination, spark intuitive insights, and enrapture you with its profound beauty.<br /><br />Whether you're a deck collector or a storyteller, a Tarot reader or a journaling seeker, the Universal Fantasy Tarot will almost surely surpass your expectations--and make you thankful that you have eyes to behold it.<br /><br />(Note: While it's easy for me to gush about this deck's beauty, I suppose I should include some minutia: the attractive, futuristic backs are fully reversible, the Minor Suits are Chalices, Wands, Swords, and Pentacles, and the Court Cards follow the Knave, Knight, Queen, and King rendering. And does it \\""read\\"" well? You bet ya! I performed a few readings and they've been uncannily insightful.)<br /><br />To see 10 images from the Universal Fantasy Tarot, visit the Review"

My 4 year old enjoyed playing on her big sisters new device with the touch-screen. I was surprised to see the screen wasn't bigger, it's about the size of a cell phone. BUT, the extra frame around that screen is actually very smart and appropriate for little hands to grip the device without touching the screen and messing with their games. I initially forgot that their fine-motor skills are vastly less mature than my own. I did add a few replacement stylus to our Amazon Wish List because I can see how the soft tip could break since she puts everything in her mouth. Minor issue in the grand scheme of things! For less than $100, I think this tablet is a great deal and awesome addition to a child's holiday or birthday wish list. And just like the LeapPad2's that we own and love, this device was SO simple to get started! Turn it on, follow on-screen prompts, register it with my LeapFrog account, download the 10 included apps, and then pass the device over for the child to play to their hearts content!<br /><br />Clearly, I'm one of the millions of parents who trust LeapFrog products because they help my children develop skills through play. My girls have fun while learning and exploring with a device that looks like my tablet (which I'm thrilled to take back now!) but the kids (mine are 2.5, 4, and 5.5) can handle this LeapPad3 with their little fingers and I'm not worried that their roughhousing is going to destroy the product.<br /><br />Disclosure: In exchange for my honest opinion on the LeapPad3 and some of their best-selling games, LeapFrog has sent me free"

I was taught to \\""always try Classical Music\\"" when trying out speakers, whether you enjoy that genre or not; it simply has the most complex musical range. So, some John Williams \\""Star Wars\\"" got queued up.<br /><br />I was gobsmacked! I stood, speechless, in front of this small-small speaker (a wee bit bigger than a business sized envelope box) and was blown away with the clarity and depth. And that was at Level 7, on my tablet! We jacked the sound up even more, and it filled the entire showroom, which is very deep and wide! I then ran some Lady Gaga, Philip Glass, and Robert Johnson through the speaker and the results were the same: stunningly full, rich, deep, with no cracking or popping.<br /><br />Ten minutes later, I walked out of that store with my FIRST Soundlink speaker: black leather with silver trim. Upon getting it home and having it jumping to some Big Bad Voodoo Daddy in the kitchen, my husband walked in and said, \\""Wow! Where are the new speakers?\\"" He was looking for some full-sized, custom installed speakers, NOT the little envelope-sized unit I had tucked in the bookcase. Of course, he also had to change the unit to various stations he listens to, including Talk Radio and he was equally impressed. So, Daddy will be having another present under the tree; good thing I received a nice bonus from my company, this year. :) I bought both of my guys the nylon covered one since they're so tough on things. The nylon one also has black speakers vs. silver, as the leather does, so I thought they'd stay \\""cleaner\\"" looking, longer.<br /><br />I just wanted to pass this along: the 2nd unit (and soon to be 3rd one, for our son) were ordered directly from Bose, online.

The increase was much smaller in high-income countries.[20]<br />Based on this information – and knowing that there is more danger in the Palm Oil than the Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil – I returned the two other jars of the Natural version and exchanged for the regular (and actually “healthier”) version. As for taste, I didn’t notice any difference.<br /><br />I’m really disappointed in Skippy for this “game” they are playing, but I guess I’ll keep buying it; just the one that is “safer”<br /><br />I hope you found this review"
783421,243828,"sample before sewing.<br /><br />The thread cutter and auto needle down are must-have features now that I've used them. I've read some comments on the poor usability of the instruction manual. On the contrary, I found it to be easy to follow and not lacking at all. The machine is a little intimidating for those who have not purchased an electronic machine before, but I just opened the manual and followed it from page 1. Within half an hour I was on my way to sewing.<br /><br />The machine isn't perfect. A couple of things that don't work well are: 1) auto needle threader is hit and miss which is a real bummer, 2) a couple of the stitches seem to be not consistent/symmetrical. The latter is not a big deal as I probably will never use those. The included letter stitches were OK but nothing of monogram quality. It's fine for putting names on articles of clothing, bags, etc.<br /><br />I've never had a Singer in the past and was a little leery with some of the online discussions about their quality. The other machines I was considering were the Brother PC420 and SE400. Both were going for more than this at the time of my purchase and for the overall value, I decided to go with the 9960. Again, I have no regrets so far (And as a guilty pleasure, I just purchase the Brother SE400 to dabble in embroidery). The overwhelming positive (5-star) review"

If not here is a list of some of them:<br /><br />1.  Relief from pain and inflammation<br />2.  Better brain function and higher intelligence<br />3.  Improved mood and less depression<br />4.  Lower incidence of childhood disorders<br />5.  Superior cardiovascular health<br />6.  Protection from heart attack and stroke<br />7.  Reduced breast, colon and prostate cancer risk<br /><br />Coromega uses top quality oil and processes it in a nondestructive manner so that you get all of the benefits without the risk of mercury and other contaminants that might be present in inferior products (I did some research). I like that Coromega includes Coenzyme Q10 for it's energy boosting and antioxidant effects, making it a two for one punch.  And did I mention it tastes great?<br /><br />Rarely does a product come along that is so innovative and good that I am this impressed.  It should be on your short list of choices for Omega-3 supplementation.  Other quality fish oils include [[ASIN:B0001VKNSM Carlson's Very Finest Fish Oil]] and [[ASIN:B0017OCE02 Krill Oil]].  Of those two, I prefer the Krill, but the Coromega packets are my first choice.  Give them a try and they may be yours as well.<br /><br />[EDIT: I've heard that some people don't like the taste.

I have tried to pinpoint exactly what it tastes like, and I think the closest thing I can get to is drinking the water out of a burnt rubber tire you found in a swamp with a dead fish inside.  Yeah... that's about right.<br /><br />After my first experience, I dreaded the fact that I had to drink 14 more bottles of this. However, I have to say, the night of the first day was the best night of sleep I have had in a very long time.  I did not associate the sleep factor with the drink at all.  I actually just woke up feeling great, and thought how odd it was to wake up so easily and rested.<br /><br />Day two I decided to just make this part of my morning routine.  However, you MUST consider this a SHOT that requires a strong chaser. I found that V8 V-Fusion is my chaser of choice due to it's full veggie and juice content. Have the bottle ready to chug.  I stop breathing, pour the entire bottle of YouthH20 in my mouth with throat closed, and when it's all out of the bottle, swallow quickly and chase with the juice.  You still have the aftertaste of burnt tire and chum there, but goes away quickly with the juice chaser.  I tend to eat a handful of dry cereal right after as well.<br /><br />So, clearly I am not the best spokesperson here giving you a lot of appealing selling points.  However, I can tell you with my personal experience of the product, that it has plenty of benefits.  It claims a lot, but all I can tell you is what I am positive that worked for me.  If I had to sum it up, it basically gives me calm positive energy.  If I went into full explanation of the feeling, I would sound like a script from the Donna Reed show.  Is it making me look or feel younger? I would have to say there is some truth to both, as when you are younger, you have a more positive and carefree"

Jermaine Dupri\\"" is an okay song. It's the weakest of Jermaine Dupri's contributions to the CD, with his own voice pleading with Mariah \\""can I get your number, girl?\\"" being a bit annoying and over-the-top cheesey. Mariah does a little bit of everything in this song; She hits some high notes, she does a little rapping about having \\""a house in Carpi\\"" and other things in her lavish life. Still, it's listenable.<br /><br />8. \\""One and Only feat. Twista\\"" is up there in the great accomplishments. You have Twista's usual fast, \\""what did he just say?\\"" lyrics flying at you. It's not a fast song, but a moody, brooding type of slow R&B/Hip-Hop thing. Mariah even steps up to the bat, rapping just as fast as Twista but pulling off a great song.<br /><br />9. \\""Circles\\"" is a song that sounds a little dated, but in a good way. It has the choir echoing some words, a feel-good, chippy tone to it, trumpets, horns, etc. It's a good song, doesn't completely click with me but it's far from being a bad song.<br /><br />10. \\""Your Girl\\"" is short! That being said, I really got into it. I liked hearing Mariah sing about being happy because in previous releases, she sounds a bit depressed or she feels she needs to escape something from her past. Perhaps this is a sign that she feels free"

Best of all, a friend recently discovered that sand at a their local Home Depot actually has traces of gold in it, so if you want to pan for real gold, you can try it out for real without kneeling at the side of a stream in California (or other Gold state). If your kids realize there is actual gold in the sand, you can keep them happy for hours, then use the leftover sand in your garden. Of course, there is no guarantee about the sand having gold, but it would be fun to check.<br /><br />Unlike other kits, this particular one can be used after the samples are done, and in the right setting, would make a nice gift. Since you will need a large tub of water, you will need to make this a kitchen event, or you will want to do it outdoors. Also, it takes time, especially for beginners, to go through the process, so plan on this project lasting awhile. If you have a group of kids trying this out at a party, you might want to buy a couple more pans.<br /><br />I am grateful to Dr. Cool for providing a complementary set for me to test out on my Granddaughter (who is 6) and to write an unbiased review"

I plugged that in and it started with no error but the sound was garbled. I went back to the built and card and tried a few more things. Now I did just update to Windows 8.1 so I figured let me try to install an updated driver. Bada bing that worked! Now most of the time I do use 1 of the external audio interfaces because they allow me to have the lowest latency (delay you hear for when you play your sound vs actually hear it). I still couldn't get past the garbled crackling and popping with the pro interfaces. I did some digging on Ubisoft's forums and found you can change some settings in the Rocksmith.ini file if you're having trouble. For me on both my pro interfaces I had to change the latency to 2 and the output buffer size to 1024. That did the trick! Now all of this took about 1 1/2 hours to figure out! I did not experience these hiccups in the original Rocksmith. This was also an annoyance but I've been using and troubleshooting PC's for over 20 years. If there's a problem with a program I'm going to eventually figure it out. From to point of view of someone who doesn't have my troubleshooting experience, I can see where this would be quite frustrating! Now I know not everyone has the same hardware configurations so it can make it a lot harder to program and get this stuff right but the install experience should not have been this complicated! I'm going to give that a big needs improvement!<br /><br />Learning your first song<br /><br />When you first start RS2014 you have to pick your guitar type, left or right handed pick, calibrate and finally tune it. After that you can immediately start playing songs. Just pick one and start learning. Like RS, RS2014 starts you out slow and then gradually gives you more and more notes as you get them right until you're at 100 percent mastery. What I really like with RS2014 is that if you have trouble with a section you can immediately go into Riff Repeater mode with exiting the song. This will focus on that section and make you play it until you get it right! Practice makes perfect and the more you play the better you will get at it!<br /><br />Other notes<br /><br />While I haven't experienced all of what RS2014 has to offer because I've only had it for a day, I can say I'm impressed with what I have tried thus far. Now if you own the original Rocksmith one would think you should be able to use those songs in the new version right? Well you can but you have to pay and additional $9.99 to Steam to transfer them to RS2014! What???? I've already payed for the game once! To me this is like paying for it again? $9.99 isn't a lot to ask but to me this should be free"

I haven't had any problems with misfeeding, incomplete lamination, or practically anything else.  The only thing I noticed was a tendency for the thin 3 mil pages to curl a bit on their trailing edge if I don't promptly remove them.  That, though, is something my other machine also did.  The ability for the machine to handle all thicknesses (and quickly switch between them) of lamination pockets has been a real plus.  At 3 mils, the laminated sheet isn't very durable; at 10 mils it's practically indestructible.<br /><br />Long story short - This is a good choice if you need a machine that can run for hours a day.

One bottle lasts a whole month and I started to see an improvement in my digestive health after just a few days of taking these. I had no weird side effects and I like that there is five different strains of Probiotics. I really like how much better I feel. I also liked how the pills were not that big and went down easily. It is routine to take them with my breakfast now. I really like the idea of the 12 hour controlled time release capsules. I have been recommending this to all of my family and friends!

Today, and with vinyl in resurgence, these sounds are more pleasant, especially since the listener knows they were engineered to be there.  As indicated before, the spatial characteristics of this recording make it a place to retreat to, as an escape that can be concentrated upon, or as background to another activity.  Nothing jumps out spontaneously, the slow evolution of electronics and silky smooth engineering, create an environment as much as a recording can.<br /><br />While Until We Meet the Sky is not unlike some of the mid-stream Tangerine Dream or other similar electronic music present and past, the balance between drama and quiet is more towards quiet than drama.  Electronica, with a strong \\""a\\"" for ambient.  There are other Solar Field albums that apparently move towards more beat, trance, or electronic balances, and this review"

Reading in the camera's manual about the issue let us know this was more than likely an issue with the above mentioned write speed.

The head of the company who had bought the sample had three expert scientists in the field who had not been able to break the contents down into something they could recognize. One of them declared that it had to have been made by God!<br /><br />Perhaps, but the one who had first stolen the sample had screamed when he saw the one that he knew was going to kill him--\\""the foot stepping around the base of the crypt, bandaged toes turning to point towards Siti\\"" and he looked upward to something that could not be...<br /><br />Dominic followed the move of the vial successfully, keeping his employer as well as the one who had hired them, Al-Miri, up to date on what he was finding...but before he could investigate the place where he thought the stolen vial was, the location had already been invaded and the scientists killed! And it appeared that those that had done it worked for Al-Miri! Dominick could have assumed that his job was done, although he was upset about the deaths. Indeed, he soon discovered that he had been paid in full!<br /><br />But something had happened during his investigation. He had met the president of the company who had bought the stolen vial and Dominic had liked him, so much so that when he learned more about his story, he agreed to help him find out what had happened! Oh, By the way, Victoria had proven her investigative skills, having followed Dominick and meeting him at various points of his own activities. Finally, she had convinced him to let her work with him. Dominick hoped that agreement would keep her from being killed...but...<br /><br />I love stories that merge history with new research. Obviously there are many companies working to prevent aging, slow it down, or eliminate it completely. Personally, I'm not sure why, but it is hypothesized in the novel that those who do not fear death are normally those who are based in their faith... At the same time, Viktor noted that many cultists could be shrouded by various ways to bring like-minded people together, including those disgruntled, fearful or outcasts for some reason... The material brought through Viktor's knowledge addsgreatly to my personal enjoyment as these issues are explored through an expert's eyes.<br /><br />Green has created two characters that both contribute to the intrigue flowing out of Professor Radek's work. It's hard for me, after just two books, to wonder how the Professor every completed his projects before Dominic was there to support him--a true testament to how well the author has merged the two in our minds and hearts! I'm looking forward to the next in this series!<br /><br />Also important is Green's ability to move readers through the suspense into explosive endings that are edgy, unpredictable, and thrilling conclusions! In this one, he even added an epilogue that, in itself, was a statement like no other! Highly recommended!<br /><br />GABixlerReview"

I wish they would have highlighted his voice more because his lyrics were new, while the female vocals are the same Silent Night lyrics we all know.<br /><br />The vocals aren't very powerful - more sweet and ethereal than strong and bold - but that's what I would expect for any rendition of Silent Night.

Each of them are great canes but this one is different and I've always wanted to see if a quad cane would make a difference.  I'm SUPPOSED to use a cane at all times because of severe arthritis in both knees.  However, at 47 I'm still a stubborn patient and don't want to follow directions.  (Or being spoiled, as my sisters would say.)  Nonetheless, this is a great cane.  I was concerned at first.  When I tried adjusting it to make it taller, it came apart.  I had figure out there were TWO push-in buttons.  I pushed them in and got the top connected to the bottom.  Then it got \\""stuck\\"" where the screw section was.  Ugh.  I then unscrewed that part and pushed down some.  It began clicking and I was able to adjust it correctly.  I put the screw back in (it's used to secure it) and off I went.<br /><br />There is a big difference between a quad and single cane.  It was more stable and I felt like it was \\""walking\\"" with me.

I'm not quite sure how he did it but he managed to encapsulate the entire thread that runs through all the novels into this one book and did so without boring us avid fans with rehashing the past.<br /><br />Blake has an enthralling writing style that draws the reader deep into the story, feeling very much a part of it.  If ever an author transported you to a new universe while reading, he is just such a writer.  I read a LOT of books, around 75-100 a year and Blake builds those universes better than just about anyone.  There are a couple of indie authors who do it almost as well (Crouch and Locke come to mind) but even they can't quite reach the level of richness that Blake brings to the story.<br /><br />If you've never read Blake, I would personally buy the entire series right now and start with book one.

I can say that going wireless makes all the difference in the world.  The wired one is this mess of cables (between the XBox and the headphone, between the controller and the headphones.)  This appears to be a pleasure.  Setup was easy.  We connected the base to our XBox via the optical cable, and it appeared to just work.  The sound is good, and we don't seem to have any interference with other 2.4 GHz devices.  I don't anticipate using this with a phone or table, but pairing them via bluetooth with my iPhone also just worked, and had good sound.<br /><br />The only thing we haven't been able to test yet is chat over the XBox.  This comes with a small dongle (they call it XBA) that plugs into the bottom of the XBox controller, which provides the wireless chat capabilities.  Two quick emails to Turtle Beach support, and a new dongle is on the way to us, but we haven't yet received it yet.  I'll update this review"

908193,3213368,"sample K-Cups to start you off.<br /><br />THE MACHINE BUILD<br />The machine itself is made out of lightweight plastic. You don't get the sense that it is flimsy, but it isn't as robust as the Cuisinart SS-700 which has a lot more heft and will definitely stay put on your kitchen counter.  This is doubly true for the lift handle and brew head of the Mr. Coffee (the thing you lift up so that you can put the K-cup inside the machine).  The plastic here is thin and will definitely not hold up to abuse.  This makes this more suitable as a home machine than it does for use in a small office, where the machine would likely take more of a beating.  The lighter construction does not affect the taste of the coffee at all and is probably a cost cutting measure.  (At the time of writing this, the Cuisinart model costs more than twice of what is being charged for the Mr. Coffee model.)  However, it may mean that the Mr. Coffee machine may not have quite the longevity of the Cuisinart.<br /><br />A number of cost saving measures were taken to keep the price down.  Options for coffee are limited.  Servings come in only two sizes: 6 and 10 ounces.  (The Cuisinart has 5 sizes between 4 and 12 ounces.)  There is no LCD display and there are no strength settings for the coffee.  There is no option for a filter within the fluid reservoir (another Cuisinart feature) and there is no special indicator that the fluid level is too low other than a blinking light around the 'Brew Now' button. (The Cuisinart flashes and LCD message.)  The reservoir itself is rather small--about 24 ounces.  Also missing is a cool light that trans-illuminates the fluid reservoir when it is too low.  The most frustrating low-end feature is that the cord is very short, meaning that your Mr. Coffee machine has to be within about a foot of an outlet.<br /><br />TASTE OF THE COFFEE<br />Still, none of this seems to matter when it comes to the taste of the coffee.  It would be nice to have an 8 ounce setting, but it isn't really necessary.  In my opinion, at sizes above 10 ounces the coffee is just too weak, so larger sizes aren't all that useful when using K-Cups.  Those who like stronger coffee tend to use two K-Cups per cup of coffee on a four or six ounce setting to get that motor oil consistency that they so love. I have never noticed any difference in using a Keurig systems that allow you to change brew strength.  The determining factor for the strength of the coffee seems to be limited by the physics of the K-Cup itself.Blinking lights and fancy indicators are fun, but are hardly necessary in such a simple machine.<br /><br />BREWING COFFEE<br />For those not in the know, to brew the coffee you lift the brew head by the handle, place the K-Cup in the well, and close the apparatus.  You select the serving size and then hit the 'Brew Now' button.  The water is heated and the coffee is brewed quickly (about 3 minutes). The tiny reservoir only holds about 24 ounces of water, meaning that you will refill it frequently.  If your cup is shallow (think tea cup) there will be a little, initial splashing as the coffee shoots out the bottom.<br /><br />Just so you know, K-Cups are not necessarily the best way to brew coffee.  I prefer using a French Press to get the most out of the bean.  (Yeah.  I know.  I'm a coffee snob.)  And if I want to brew a quick pot of coffee that still tastes better than one from a K-Cup, a standard, drip coffee maker does just fine, thank you.<br /><br />But you can't beat the K-Cup for convenience.  K-Cups produce a far better coffee than any instant I've tasted (including that fancy Starbucks VIA stuff) and it is the best kind of coffee you can make on the go without any fuss or muss. It's far faster than a French Press, less finicky, and easier to clean up.  It doesn't take the prep needed for drip coffee or take all that time.  And if you have a family where everyone has a variety of tastes, K-Cups allow everyone to stock their favorite flavor.<br /><br />ECOFRIENDLY AND ECONOMICAL K-CUPPING<br />If you want to keep things more environmentally sound, there are a number of solutions available for reusable inserts that work just like the K-Cups but that can be filled with your favorite coffee.  This way you don't have to increase the number of used K-Cups that are taking over our landfills today.  This may take away some of the convenience factor but is still far faster than other methods to brew coffee.<br /><br />A reusable Keurig Cup also decreases the expense of the K-Cups. A pound of coffee yields somewhere around 72 ten-ounce cups of coffee.  On Amazon (on the day of the writing of this review"

My brother is starting a new business and if he hands out a simple business card it might get lost in the shuffle.  If he has a laminated one, it will stand out and be tucked in a secure place for when needed.  A laminated card can make the difference between getting an extra client or letting the job go to someone else.<br /><br />FEATURES:<br /><br />►  Business Card Size, Laminates Items Up to 2” x 3.5”<br />►  5 mil Thickness, 100 Pouches<br />►  Photo Safe (PAT Tested & Approved)<br />►  Water-resistant and easy wipe-clean surface<br />►  Glossy finish brightens colors and enhances clarity<br /><br />These pouches are exactly what we’ll need to get the job done.  A well-centered, standard business card, once laminated, will have about 1/8” border.  I’m talking about a card made by Vista, an online printer that many people use.  The card looks great and does stand out from the crowd.  The colors pop and obviously looks like one is trying to be a bit more professional than the next guy.  Every little bit counts.  Simply remember to put the sealed end into the laminator first.<br /><br />The 5 mil pouches made the business card flexible, but not stiff.  For general purposes these are perfect.  Obviously if you need the 7 mil, which are very stiff you probably need them for corporate identification purposes or things like licenses.  Most of us don’t need or want that type of laminated product, especially with a business card.

Instructions recommend going to their website if you wish to add channels that may not be listed in a normal setup.  Let's say your friend down the street is streaming something from his house and you want to easily add it to your favorites, you'd input this information on the VTech website for your radio.  Nada!  I found the Vtech website to be of no benefit to the customer.  Useless...and frustrating for what should be a pretty simple procedure.  Additionally, I found the website (likely in China) wanting wayyy too much information.  Thumbs down.  Great radio.  Poor company support for this product.  Your browser...Firefox or Google Chrome may also warn you on this site.<br /><br />=====<br /><br />SETUP --  The first thing to remember is that this radio requires you have a wireless Internet connection (router) and in close proximity in order to work properly.  More important, you have to know the \\""name\\"" of your wireless Internet network (Not the brand name - but the name you or someone assigned to the network when it was initially set up) AND you'll also need to know the \\""password\\"" for your wireless network.  Without this information, you'll not be able to proceed.  When you have (1) \\""network name\\"" and (2) the \\""password\\"" your setup is relatively easy.  If all this makes you feel a little uncomfortable, call your neighborhood teen computer wizard and they'll have it humming for you in no time ---but they'll still need to know network name and password. (**make sure they don't write it down and put it in their pocket or you'll most likely have uninvited guests on your network very soon thereafter**)<br /><br />GREAT SOUND - Being one who is very particular when it comes to \\""good\\"" sound from a radio, I'd have to rate the Vtech IS9181's audio fidelity outstanding.  Very impressive.  Exceptional in fact...though you should remember that audio streams originating from different stations across the world will have differing levels of quality and volume. Otherwise, not everything you hear is going to be of \\""exceptional\\"" audio fidelity.  Different stations (individuals) stream at different rates and their fidelity will not be the same.  For those with a big budget (stations in major cities -  The WBBM's, the WBZ's or KCBS's of the world make it sound like they're in the room with you --- reason is ... they can afford to \\""fill that (Internet) pipe\\"" with all the data that provides this truly awesome sound you'll hear.  Remember, small operators and even many radio stations in mid-size cities often stream at a \\""lesser rate\\"" due to smaller budgets.  When they do, the result is a lower quality (and less intense) signal to your Internet radio.  So...don't be surprised if you find yourself adjusting the volume if you scan through your favorites stations frequently.  I did not find this to be troublesome, however, as I'm not continually changing stations.<br /><br />STATION AVAILABILITY -  There are just tons of stations/streams from which to choose on the Internet.  They are NOT all listed in your radio, though there are many from which to choose.  You can go to your Vtech website account to add stations you may not initially find available.  I have not yet tried this feature so don't know how well it works.  If your neighbor down the street is streaming a show to the Internet you'd like to listen to, I presume you'd go to your VTech online account and plug in his Internet streaming address, then it would be available as a selection on your radio.  If there's anything troubling about stream availability is that many stations' (in smaller cities) who are listed, are not reliable when it comes to a constant and \\""reliable\\"" signal for your radio.  You'll often see on the VTech's screen, after it searches for a signal, \\""Check back later. \\"" OK --  This is not good if you want to count on this station to supply your entertainment/information with certain reliability.  I was surprised to find a number of rather well-known radio stations from around the U.S. falling down on this count.<br /><br />REMOTE CONTROL - Vtech decided to go the \\""chintzy\\"" route on their remote control for this radio.  Unimpressive... and I can see where this thing, when subjected to much use, could be troublesome in no time.  Only thought by engineering in this instance seems to have been to \\""keep it cheap\\"" ...and they succeeded.  Too bad, this is an otherwise well-designed radio that works and sounds great.  The remote control has those awful membrane buttons and overall.. just feels like junk.<br /><br />MOST PROBLEMATIC on the VTech IS9181 - Disappearing Favorites - Don't take my word as gospel on this as I have so little experience in using this radio.

The SpyderCheckr24 software needs to be downloaded and installed before you can do anything, but you can take your test shots of the side with 24 color chips any time you want. Simply set the card so that the white chip is the upper right, and the brown chip is the lower left. Position the card at about 45 degrees with even lighting, and ensure that the card is not filling the frame. Figure you want to have an inch or so around all edges, at least. This is because the corners of most lenses are the softest and show the most distortion. You will crop down to the card in your usual editing software - Lightroom in my case. Nothing of the area around the card should show.<br /><br />The image needs to be white balanced within Lightroom (or whatever photo editor you're using). Basically follow your usual workflow to clean up a photo, and then save it somewhere as a TIFF. You will open this in the SpyderCHECKR24 software. From there, you will adjust the color blocks that are laid over your original photo, attempting to get each one as close to the center of each color chip. You can only adjust for placement, width, and height of the entire selection of colors, not each individual one. You also have the option of shifting the color mode from Saturation, which is best for general photos, to Colorimetric, which the manual states is for &#34;the most literal results,&#34; useful if you're photographing a company's product that feature specific, and often trademarked, colors, and Portrait, which will slightly desaturate your model's skintone in your final image. I opted for Saturation. Save your calibration with a name you will recognize, and then head back to Lightroom.<br /><br />Once in Lightroom, simply open a photo, go to the Develop tab, and from the left panel of options, go to Presets, then User Presets (the last option in this pane, and your calibration should be available.

926666,2563162,"sample. Accordingly, I began tracking down the samplers that Metropolis puts out at least once a year (but normally twice a year, under one name or another) and listening to the things that they arranged on them. Something I discovered through this was that (1) I really like the place they've taken electronic/EBM/industrial/dancefloor music to and (2) that I really enjoy the way they construct their listening vices into such wondrous packages. A little of everything is always included in those portions of listening pleasure, from the heavier worlds of electronic disdain (although these are more noticeable on the Electropolis releases that on Critical Mass) to the more somber EBM ballads that make the mind dance, and this actually does what a sampler should do. it provides a person of an overview of the label and the types of sounds it carries.<br />On this release, I found myself actually fond of the Dos Ich release (not normally a band for me) and the Suicide Commando sounds (again, not normally in my EBM fields of play). Both are a tad on the side of rudimentary vocals, not really to my liking most of the time, but these two songs were actually pretty good this time around. Funker Vogt's Under Deck is good here, but I like the album song better because the remix rends the beat a little while playing with it. Still, a song about being aboard a vessel in the midst of warfare is fine, and better still when its set to sounds that capture the event in a strangely understandable way. Velvet Acid Christ's contribution was also really good, showcasing the band when it was still in the dark forms of drug-related recording and not yet outside of this box, giving the listener something to enjoy as well. Haujobb's Subsonic is less experimental than most of their normal work and more electronic, keeping a high BPM count and actually constructing a masterful combination of beats and lyrics, Informatik's Oblivion is one of the turns in the road that took the band away from the voxed lyrics it was so well known for in the past while keeping a more growling sound to their EBM sounds that are a bit more dancefloor oriented than before, and Icon of Coil's release is good, but their first album actually produced a more thought-provoking look at anger and all its many formations in the mind. Wolfsheim, sometimes compared to Peter Murphy in vocals but unjustly so, is always at the top of their game and anything they provide will have qualities in it that are commendable (although a bit slower paced for some people and the opera mixtures in some songs a bit too over the EBM top), Fictional is a Funker Vogt sideproject that lets them play a little more with sounds outside of warfare and is more electronic than harsh in this song Blue Lights, and Mesh's Because it Scares Me is one that is slowly paced but that is worthy of a listen as well.<br />In the realm of samplers, I'd have to give this Critical Mass release a hefty approval rating because it has some many songs that can be listened to over and over again. While not exactly introducing me to many bands I hadn't heard of, it worked as a preview"

931118,2154973,"freebie.  Basically, what this release provides you with, is a LIVE VERSION OF SURREALISTIC PILLOW, minus \\""Somebody to love\\"" and a couple of other songs, you probibly have in live versions anyway. ITs not too far fetched to consider many of these songs LIVE DEMOS for Surrealistic Pillow. For that reason alone, if you are a fan of JA's second album, you REALLY should buy this 2CD set. Also, since the price is very reasonable for a 2CD set, you don't need to feel cheated by the relatively poor sound quality of the second CD. The packaging is well done, and there's even a little essay hidden behind the second CD, telling you how great the performances are on this set, in case you need reminding. Of the four Jefferson Airplane Live releases Collectors Choice just provided the fan base, THIS IS THE CD SET TO BUY. (Even if you are buying it just for the live version of DCBA-25.)ovely harmony by Grace. This is why to this day Marty and Grace's vocals are legendary for merging harmonies with utmost perfection. There's not a sour note in that WHOLE song's performance. (And Grace is singing some odd, difficult harmonies.) \\""MY GRANDFATHER\\""S CLOCK\\"" is a song in the same way \\""TURN OUT THE LIGHTS\\"" is a song from BLESS ITS POINTED LITTLE HEAD. Basically about one minute of Jorma playing a guitar piece, with Jack accompanying him on bass. Very lightly Paul can be heard fumbling around on guitar, with maybe hi hat splashes at one point, and no vocals. Half of the two minute length, is blank tape left running before the last number begins.The OTHER SIDE OF THIS LIFE by Fred Neil concludes disc two. This song's performance merits praise, but by this point, almost EVERY performance of The OTHER SIDE OF THIS LIFE became an extended excursion into acidwonderland.     Overall its hard to judge this release. If I didnt know the quality of the bootleg sound circulating of the 11/25 evening show found on Disc ONE, I wouldnt be too disappointed by what i hear at all. After all, we're talking about recordings made 45 years ago. Disc Two is more difficult to listen to, due to sonic constrictions of the source tape, but considering the price of this 2CD set, I consider it a free"

It did an okay job of covering up the redness, but you can still clearly see the bumpiness underneith this makeup. I also don't like the way this makeup looks on my face. It doesn't look very natural in my opinion. You can definitely tell I am wearing makeup. I also have some very fine lines. So fine you can't even see them with the naked eye.

Most of the time the workers go insane after they leave the mining colony.  Once in a while they go insane at the colony.  That is how it becomes the Marshall's problem.  The plant manager wants the Marshall killed and sends for a group of assassins to kill the Marshall.  Connery monitors the whole transmission.

964346,1442395,"freebie eye masks that you get from international flights, but when the opportunity to try SmarterRest came around, i figured it would be worth it to try an upgraded version.<br /><br />Made from soft, satiny material on the outside and plush velvety material on the inside, this sleep mask affixes by a velcro strap (vs an elastic, often found on the very cheap ones). I have a fairly large head and while the strap did fit, it left exposed some of the prickly end of the velcro, this caught and snagged on my pillow as i slept. Which is why I've docked it one star. I understand it's tough to have something fit everyone well, but this is one of the downsides of this product for bigger heads.<br /><br />Otherwise, the eye mask fit fairly comfortably on my head and did a very good job of blocking out the light (especially when it's worn correctly).  The velcro issue on the strap was annoying, but not a deal breaker. The strap itself is a little stiff, and I would have docked it another 1/2 star for that (if amazon supported 1/2 stars!)<br /><br />I appreciate the fact that the strap holds two foam earplugs as I often forget them. The ear plugs are your standard memory foam earplugs. The mask also has a satin carry case, which is nice as it keeps it clean.<br /><br />Be sure to read the card that comes with this mask, it has some unexpected humor including &#34;Come to The Dark Side. We've Got Something Better Than Cookies: The Sleep No One Earth Delivers&#34;. This may be overstating things for an eye mask. But this eye mask is good enough to do the job.<br /><br />Smarter Rest provided me with a sample to review"

I am still LOVING this product and what it continues to do for me :) and I already ordered another jar.s so good, you could easily use it as a spread.<br /><br />Some of you may think this product is a little pricey.  I believe it is worth every penny.  As a bonus, you may find you can save money on some of the other skin products you no longer need.  It also contains NO parabens.  (According to my research, parabens are considered dangerous to our health, even in small amounts, because they accumulate, with cumulative effects.  Many companies use parabens as a preservative, to give the product a longer shelf life.  Parabens are said to be much less expensive.)<br /><br />Bee Nigma comes with 100% guarantee.  If you are not satisfied, the website claims you can return it within 60 days.  It also says it is a CUMULATIVE product, which means the longer you use it, the more benefits you suck up through your skin.  It also claims to be anti-aging, rejuvenitive, and lifts, plumps, and reduces fine lines and wrinkles.<br /><br />Making Bee Nigma does not harm the hard-working little bees that generously provide the primary ingredients of this product.<br /><br />Oh, BTW - I am not a 25 year old with skin that hasn't had time to season.  My skin has been 42 years old for the last 22 years.  I am thrilled with this product and it has far exceeded my expectations!  And, when you see an unexplained bright light coming from across a dimly lit room, it is probably just the glow coming from someone's skin--someone who is using BEE NIGMA!<br /><br />Note that I am not a health care professional.  These are my opinions based on my personal experience and research.  Also note that if you are allergic to bee pollen or bee stings, you probably are unable to use this product and should consult your doctor before considering it.  As a matter of fact, the label says not to use it if you have a known bee allergy.<br /><br />I was so impressed by this product, that I took the extra time to provide you with some research and a lot of information.  If you try it, I believe you will be everybit as impressed as I am.<br /><br />BTW - Although I received this product as a free"

It was like 3 sheets.<br />- Print speed IS pretty fast, and it is capable of edge-to-edge printing, which is nice.<br />- The 'quick print' function (to save ink) is kind of frustratingly buried in the menus.<br />- The auto document feeder is nice, and has not jammed or produced off-kilter images.<br />- The ability to fax directly from the printer or my computer has been handy and has worked well. Speed has been normal.<br />- I have never had the need to use the front USB port or memory card ports on printers. Ever. That's why I have a computer.<br />- Printed pages and photos do seem to dry fast, though photo brightness depends on the paper.<br />- I have not really had any issues with paper jams like my in-laws have had with their Canon Pixma, but the Canon is quieter and has a better interface.<br />- Printing envelopes with this printer is a pain in the rear, and the address is often crooked. An envelope guide (to keep them straight) would have been nice.<br /><br />Thus far, I do feel this printer is worth the cost. It has a lot of features and has performed well. When I received this printer, I actually had my eye on the Canon printer. This one has performed better than I expected and restores a little shine to Epson's name. I don't \\""love it\\"" to the point that I wouldn't shop around if I had to replace it tomorrow, but I DO like it and would recommend it as a solid home printer.<br /><br />Please note, Epson also now has the 645 model, which they did not have when I received this printer for review"

1011662,3256649,"sample on my Kindle and bought the book based on that, eagerly looking forward to sinking in to the book while on vacation in Cape Cod.<br /><br />Well, at first I did enjoy the book, the exposition featuring the main characters was well done (remember, that is what made me want to buy the book in the first place) and oh so promising. But then the story starts to sink under its own weight, and this author does two of my least favorite things.<br /><br />1. She employs the tired device of stopping a chapter at a suspenseful point and starting the next chapter in a different setting with different characters. That is okay if you are writing such a taut story that the suspense is a feature of the experience. But \\""Seating Arrangements\\"" is an introspective, thought-y, word-y story that takes place over the course of a mere few hours leading up to a wedding. So the effect of dropping the plot after a chapter and jumping to something else feels choppy and annoying...not suspenseful.<br /><br />2. She describes too much! Just when the story could be interesting, we have to hear all about how the items looked and felt around the character. Ugh. Towards the end of the book when one character falls off a roof, there is a paragraph that stretches for longer than one page! And it is all description. Double ugh.<br /><br />Recommendation: No. Sorry for the poor review"

1012952,2350599,"sample that was provided for an honest assessment. On the plus side, this is an easy-to-use blood pressure and heart rate monitor. You do need to wrap it around your wrist correctly in order to get an accurate reading. It requires 2 x AAA batteries, not included. In order simply to take your blood pressure, you sit quietly for about 5 minutes, then, with your palm up, wrap the monitor around your wrist and attach the velcro strap snugly but comfortably. Hold the monitor at approximately the same level as your heart. (The correct way to do this is graphically illustrated on the strap itself).<br /><br />There are 3 buttons. The red one in the middle has the usual computer icon for on/off. Press it, and in seconds the unit will pressurize and begin to count down as it measures your systolic and diastolic pressure. On the right vertical side of the monitor, you will see &#34;SYS&#34; and then, &#34;DIA.&#34; &#34;Systolic&#34; is the maximum arterial pressure in your heart, and &#34;diastolic&#34; is the minimum, as your heart rests between beats. Below that is &#34;PUL,&#34; for pulse. As your stats are being taken, you will see the numbers count down, and an icon of a heart beating in tune with your own. When your results are in, you will observe your pulse rate as a number (beats per minute) in the lower portion of the screen. If you should have an irregular beat, a little graph will show as well.<br /><br />So far so good. Simple to get an accurate reading of your pressure and pulse, if you attach it correctly (remember, palm up, monitor on your wrist so you can read it). HOWEVER, if you want to delve deeper into the benefits of this monitor, and we do, you must deal with something that is one of our pet peeves. The instructions on the box, and in the little manual, are NOT written by a native English speaker. For instance, &#34;Disturbances of blood circulation patient uses under doctor's instruction.&#34; Eh? And, &#34;It can not be used for baby of people who can not be right to express their willing.&#34; Come again?? There are many other examples, and that's too bad, because there are advanced functions built into this device that are very useful.<br /><br />I spent the time to figure it out. Maybe this will help you. The on-board memory records your heart history, with date and time, but first, you have to set it. (If you've ever programmed a digital watch using 2 buttons, it's much like that). With the device on your wrist (or on a table top so you can see the screen), without pushing the power button, press and hold down the &#34;S&#34; (or &#34;Set&#34;) button until you see a line of numbers appear along the top of the screen. On the right will be 4 flashing digits -- the year. While they're still flashing, quick-press the left &#34;M&#34; (for &#34;Memory&#34;) button, and the years will advance. Stop when you hit the right one! IF you go by it, as I did, you will have to manually scroll through 100 years until you pass 2099, and come around again. Again, if you're like me, it might take you a few attempts to get the hang of it, as the screen quickly goes blank and you have to start over. Once you have the correct year showing, quick-press the &#34;S&#34; button and the month will begin to flash towards the left side of the screen. Again, use the M button to get to the right one. Repeating this process will eventually get you to the day, then hour, and minute. It says in the manual that you can also set language preference here, but not so, at least, not on our unit. All that might sound a bit complicated, but persevere and you'll get the hang of it.<br /><br />Ok -- so how do you set this up to record the data for 2 users? Since you've got the date and time set, wait until the screen goes blank once more. Quick-press the &#34;S&#34; button, and you'll notice a tiny human icon in the upper left corner. Quick-press S again, and the icon jumps one over. When you look closely, you'll see a &#34;1&#34; and &#34;2&#34; on the chests. This is how you set the device for two x users (which we want to do). If you're the only user, of course, don't bother with this step.<br /><br />If you're one of two users, use the S button to get your icon showing. Only now press the ON button, and relax. The machine will start to whirr, the cuff puffs up, and the monitor will measures your blood pressure and heart rate, and displays it in an easy-to-read fashion.<br /><br />When you want to review"

1014227,1419046,"sample I used my meter. The meter said 183. The lab test was 186! I later found out it was from the maltodextrin in the jello. Even the powdered Splenda that measures like sugar has maltodextrin in it. If you are ingesting maltodextrin, then your pancreas is working to \\""clear\\"" it from your body just as it would have to do with table sugar is what I've been told by my endocrinologist.

According to the ingredient list, this product does not use maltodextrin.<br /><br />I ordered this syrup because I love the taste of brown sugar and thought I'd eventually find a use for it.

1015561,2675763,"sample picture if you request one. PLEASE BARE IN MIND, while the SAMSUNG has more options, it will take a real techoholic to want to figure out each and every feature, I'm still getting WARMED up to it.<br /><br />Google Sync - The google sync on both phones immediately got all my contacts into the phone, there are a ton of applications so if you have a gmail account even with a blackberry, all your contacts are gonna be SYNCED with either the EVO or the EPIC. Google has a very funny deal-sealing way of having the google sync on the BLACKBERRY. If you're dumping your blackberry, make sure you do google sync and sync all your contacts before activating the EPIC. Ask a store rep to do it for you before buying it BLINDLY from them.<br /><br />BROWSING - Browsing on the Evo is the best browsing I have ever seen. It still wins over the Epic by just a single point. Epic still gets a 9/10 while Evo because of it's multi-touch gets a perfect 10. There is no lag while browsing or using the touchscreen at all. This is a dream come true for people who've ever had the Samsung Instinct from two years ago. These two phones make my Blackberry look so bad and that's one thing to love and admire about Androids, the fact that they have such capable awesomse fast, intelligent browsers. I have no complaints whatsoever. I have an iPod touch and its half as good at best and I'll tell you the iPod touch is amazing. EVO wins by a life because it's the best at it. Epic is still about two and a half times as good as my Sprint BOLD.<br /><br />On-Screen Typing : On screen typing on the Evo is way better because of HTC's on screen Qwerty. Swype comes built in with the EPIC. I've never used it, I don't believe in it, just looks too cheesy. Evo has a great typing mechanism but EPIC assumes that unless you're typing casually, you will use the physical keyboard to type. The Evo's typing is better than the iPhone's or the iPods. I haven't played with the iPhone 4 yet.<br /><br />SLIDE OUT / PHYSICAL KEYBOARD : I will go for the Epic over the Evo because it has a wonderful, non-cheesy, idiot proof keyboard slide out. This is the best addition possible besides the camera and the bundled accessries. I despise the Moment's keyboard in comparison though Moment isn't a bad phone. The EVO is supposed to be Sprint and Samsung's replacement for the SAMSUNG MOMENT.<br /><br />I've been away from my 2 day old Epic. I will discover more things and shall let you know. Any cons? The capacitive keys on the front could've been a touch more responsive. On the Evo they seem more responsive. I'm in no hurry for the Samsung Epic to get 2.2 and I'm sure they won't disappoint.<br /><br />Wallpapers look brighter, more alive, sleeker, sexier, more sophisticated on the Epic. When you're in your menu on the Evo you go from top to bottom while on the Epic, if you click Applications you go left right right right. So it's horizontal menu browsing on the Epic and vertical on the Evo.<br /><br />There is so much more for me to discover. I told someone earlier this year that no phone will ever match the iPhone but technology has an astounding way of shocking me. I'm an absolute geek and am glad that the Epic exists. It's like action sequences on the Lord of the Rings : Twin Towers while Evo is like the Matrix chase scenes from Reloaded. Both are feature packed phones but I love to type and the additional keyboard is fantastic for typing.<br /><br />Wi-Fi Browsing : If both phones were used on the Wifi, the Epic is blazingly fast and obviously an easy hands down winner. I didn't try browsing on both using the 3G signal in Manhattan though it loaded a youtube video and downloaded an mp3 rather fast.<br /><br />MISCELLANEOUS THINGS: Epic comes with a game, it also a Samsung HUB, it doesn't have an HDMI port but has something called DLNA which enables you to wireless connect the phone with compatible televisions and monitors. The AMOLED screen is Samsung's proprietary format I read somewhere, Samsung will invest $2 Billion in the next year or two for making screen for all touchscreens.<br /><br />I'm sorry about how random this review"

It is lightweight and absorbs quickly, and throughout the day my skin doesn't get as greasy as it was with Olay Total Effects SPF lotion. I cannot say that I've noticed a reduction in winkles because I don't have any, but, at the end of the day my skin looked more rested, a difference I never noticed with Olay. Whether this was because my skin was actually improving or because the lotion helped to prime my makeup better, who knows, but I like it.    The eye cream is my only con with this set. I was using it everyday along with the other two products, however I was starting to get headaches and watery eyes throughout the day. I realized it was this eye cream because the morning I stopped using it, I didn't have a headache and my eyes were not as irritated.

The group has a real gift for catchy melodies as evident in the aforementioned tune as well as in \\""We Used to Vacation\\"" and \\""St. John.\\""  Really the CD is full of immediately catchy hooks and melodies that suck you in and don't let go (\\""Passing the Hat\\"", etc.).

Both products are going to leave a matte finish, but this seemed to blend better.<br /><br />Also, Toppik seemed to make my scalp itch and exacerbate my dandruff. I can't think of any legitimate reason why that would be the case, but it did. Since using Viviscal, I haven't had either problem.<br /><br />In sum, happy that I tried this, as it will probably become my new choice.<br /><br />If you haven't used a fiber filler before, it works as described in other review"

I didn't realize it had that feature at first until I just happened to catch it in the manual.  (Yes, I do read the user manuals - sometimes).  I also really like that wide sewing surface, plus it easily slides away when you need to sew something narrow.  It's easy to thread and bobbin winding is easy too.  I guess the only small complaint I have is:  My old machine would wind the bobbin right in the bobbin compartment, so as soon as the bobbin was full, you were ready to go.  With this one, you wind the bobbin in the top compartment next to the thread holder, then have to put to bobbin in the bobbin compartment before sewing.  Since I like the machine so well, I can live with that small inconvenience.  I spent a lot of time researching new machines.  I looked at super expensive ones and ones not so pricey. I looked at every brand I could find. I read review"

1030255,3282159,"sample of this supplement and figured it was a good chance to determine whether or not it was worth buying again in the future. I've been using it for about a week and I've already experienced significant improvement in my energy throughout the day. No one is more surprised by this than me because I generally don't expect supplements to show results rapidly. I see them more as a long-term restorative that help support a return to normal or better function when one has some sort of deficiency. Please note that I don't think this will necessarily help someone who isn't thyroid function-deficient. If you're in good health in terms of thyroid function, chances are this isn't going to make you feel better.<br /><br />I looked into the ingredients to try to understand where the benefits might be coming from. I will offer a compilation of what I learned here so others can be saved the searches (most information via WebMD):<br /><br />Schizandra: Improve liver function by stimulating enzymes and cell growth.<br />Ashwagandha Root: Anti-inflammatory, anti-fluid retention.<br />Bladderwrack: A type of seaweed which contains iodine and is often used for underactive thyroid as well as a laxative.<br />Cayenne Pepper: Essentially hot pepper to boost metabolism.<br />Kelp: Increases thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). This information was via a scientific study posted by NCBI, the National Center for Biotechnology Association).<br />Tyrosine: Combines with iodine to make thyroid hormone. (Information from the University of Maryland Medical Center)<br /><br />My feeling is that you should not take this if you take any sort of medication for thyroid as it may interact with your medication. At the very least, check with your doctor. However, if you have thyroid function that is operating on the low end of healthy, I think this may help and would certainly recommend it based on my positive experiences. The price at the time of this review"

I needed no manual and that was good because there was no manual in the box.  I was connected and watching content within 15 minutes of opening the box.  The remote is very cool. Simple, compact and easy. A track ball or scroll wheel would make it better but it works just fine as is.  The streaming is flawless.Start up is quick.  The HD is very good and the SD is as good as SD gets.   I experimented and unplugged the WiFi router while I was watching a program. The router was off for 30 seconds and the film played on without any hint that there was a connection error.     This is the first device of its type that I purchased so I have nothing to compare it to but I also have no complaints and I am very pleased with the new source of content that I enjoy (for free"

1058509,1928508,"freebie brush your dentist palms off on you every time you have a cleaning.<br /><br />There are things about Sonicare I don't like, but they have mostly to do with cost and disposal. You'll find six brushes on Amazon for $66. Costco has them all the time for $45 which is still ridiculously high for 6. Still, their brush is effective, much more so than Braun and Oral B and I have used both. The second thing is that when the battery dies, you can't get a replacement, so you have to get a whole new Sonicare. I think if Philips is so concerned about your health, they should be concerned about landfill and less about profits. (The brush/battery issue reminds me very much of the fact that HP can sell a printer for $70, and the ink cartridges and photo paper will cost just under $5,000 in the life of the printer. Okay, exaggeration, but not by much. HP makes 66% of their printer profits off ink. I'll bet that Philips makes the same off its brushes and replacement sets.)<br /><br />It's comfortable in your hand, more comfortable than the Elite. And I think with the heavier Elite, there's a tendency to brush harder. Let the Sonicare do the brushing, and pay attention to their tips.<br /><br />If you're reading this review"

There is a warm white version of the lamps. This lamp appears a lot brighter than a 30 Watt halogen lamp. The focus is a little tighter than a standard bare bulb, or even one in a reflector housing. The angle of spread is around 60 degrees; I think it might be a little narrower than that.<br /><br />Each lamp comes with a transformer that can take 100-220 Volt input. The output is 9 volts. The output side has an automotive / electronics snap connector. It wouldn't be too hard to extend the length of that wire. The transformer will have to be in an electrical box because it is fed with 110V.<br /><br />The light samples I received all have a small silver LE logo on the face of the trim ring.

I chose him because he's the most energetic of my five dogs, and the second-smallest at 52 pounds.  (Clearly he is over the ideal weight for this leash, but he is a good leash walker when he stays focused).<br /><br />Zeke likes to walk ahead of me, so I wanted him to extend the leash to the maximum to see what he would do.  Would he pull, or would he stop?  Whenever he felt the leash go tight, he stopped and came right back to me.  The slight snapping noise in the device spooked him, which is why he quickly stopped and turned around whenever he felt the leash tighten.  So perhaps this is an unplanned training device!<br /><br />The handle is ergonomically designed and feels fine in my small hand.  Zeke quickly learned to walk by my side on his own.  Snapping the leash in a lock position is easy:  just press down on the black button and press toward the handle to keep the device locked.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like about this leash is the loud retracting  sound it made when the leash would automatically wind back into itself.  Even Zeke didn't care for the sound.<br /><br />Retractable leashes are best used on dogs that are already leash-trained, or older, slower dogs that already know the routine.  Zeke did well and the leash handled well, even that first powerful pull at the beginning.  I do not recommend any retractable leash  on a puppy, a scared dog or an aggressive dog, or a dog first learning about leashing.  This leash is well-made and can handle the smaller dogs with ease.<br /><br />The only thing now to assess is durability, and that will take time.<br /><br />I received a free"

When this new people arrive, the visitors' tale of woe doesn't add up, and their plea for help may be a prelude to invasion. Kara must decide if her warrior's instincts are keeping her cautious or are they betraying her and endangering thousands.\\""  \\""A Shore Too Far\\"" is advertised as the first book in \\""The Daughters of Damendine\\"" series.  OVERVIEW/ANALYSIS: \\""A Shore Too Far\\"" is a very entertaining series debut which takes place on a secondary world with the usual pseudo-medieval society but with no magic so far. The novel is a first person narration from Kara Asgrand, daughter of the king of Avandi and commander in chief of the army.  Kara is also a rival to her two brothers, Eric, a very able administrator and current ruler of Abrigol, the most important city outside of the capital, and Kollus who is mostly a scholar, though as royalty he also rules a province - one of the conceits here is that in Kara's country the succession is decided by the king stepping down infavor of a successor that may or may not be one of his children - this is really unlikely to work and would lead to countless civil wars as history shows in any society without clear and accepted lines of succession and sometimes even in those, but that's more of a plot device so far to motivate the rivalry and subtext between Kara and her older brother Eric.  When a strange fleet is sighted close to Abringol, Kara summons her fastest cavalry and rides there to strengthen Eric's defenses, while the king and the rest of the army will tae some ten days or more to get there. What follows is a story of first contact between the Avandi and the mysterious strangers that call themselves the Kullobrini and claim they were blown off course to a colonization mission on some remote and less hospitable areas of the continent, while now a sickness developing on their fleet forced them to come ashore in the Avandi kingdom. Any misstep can lead to a deadly confrontation and Kara has to make the decisions as her father puts her unexpectedly in charge of the \\""alien diplomacy\\"" over her governor brother  The main strength of the novel is in the first person narration of Kara. While the novel is predictable to some extent, the tension is maintained to the end and the pages turn by themselves since you do not want to stop until you find out the implied secrets of the Kullobrini and how things will turn out for both people.  As an added bonus there is some backstory recounted and we understand more about Kara's relationship with her siblings too. In addition to Eric, there are a few notable secondary characters - the Kullobrini leaders, a young ambitious and very wealthy merchant of Abrigol who is an on-and-off flame of Kara, while grizzled veteran Gonnaban plays well the role of the princess' master at arms and all around skeptic.  Overall, A Shore Too Far (A+) is another very promising indie series debut which I recommend for a fast and very enjoyable read. I also want to note that the novel wraps up its main storyline so it's a standalone from this point of view, but of course more is promised in the interesting universe created by the author.  Note: This review"

The Audio Technica AT-PL120S turntable is an excellent value for the money and will serve your purpose well.  Price paid: $175.99a replacement).  Yet the turntable itself works flawlessly and has no visible outward damage.  If it can survive abuse like that it can surely survive carting it around if one chooses to use it in a mobile or DJ setting.  I have no intention of using it for scratching or DJ work, so I really cannot comment about its durability for such purposes, although I suspect it would hold up quite competitively.    The only negatives about this turntable are the fact that it is totally manual operation (which may be bothersome for those who have been used to fully automatic turntables in the past) and that its phono cable is built-in and not detachable.  It would have been nice to have a detachable phono cable so higher quality cable could be used, but for the money that is a minor point to quibble over.  The Cakewalk software is functional, and it has some nice sound-editing features such as loudness boost, click and pop noise elimination, and other sound effects.  However, I find that it is not as user-friendly as Roxio Media Creator, particularly when it comes to splitting large album-side files into individual song files.  But the software is a free"

1096989,1231156,"sample guitar lesson and performance of two songs (including “Green Green Rocky Road” which is prominently featured in the Coen brothers’ film). This lesson comes from one of Grossman’s Vestapol Guitar Instruction DVDs.<br /><br />As DVR states early in the interview, he considered himself a “jazz player”, not a folk singer. And the songs he selects reflects this. There are numbers made famous by Bessie Smith, Jelly Roll Morton and Clarence Williams (who Van Ronk reveals took he and some of his musician friends under his wing, when they were kids. He discusses black vaudevillian Bert Williams (and sings Williams’ lesser-known song “Somebody”) and tells the story of how Tom Paxton came to Greenwich Village in 1961 (which pre-dates another scene in “Inside Llewyn Davis”!). Van Ronk was there when Bob Dylan made his first performances in New York (coming east to write songs to amuse the then-ailing Woody Guthrie) and his stories of Dylan’s early days are fascinating.<br /><br />Grossman’s production techniques are great. The sound of both the interview and performance segments is superb. And the camera closes in on both Van Ronk’s face and hands. The screen image is in standard format – this was before HD TV.<br /><br />As I watched and listened to Van Ronk for the hour-plus of interview and performance (the bonus lesson brings the tital time to 84 minutes), I couldn’t help wondering if he knew this just might be his last recorded performance. Be that as it may, if you are a DVR fan or have just discovered him from the Coen brothers’ film, I think you’ll want to see this DVD.<br /><br />I hope you found this review"

1102190,692217,"sample prints I brought with me and assured me my software was just fine -- my problem was my HP printer.  She was an amateur photographer who only used Epson printers.  I adamantly insisted it was my software, but she adamantly insisted right back that it was my HPprinter.  She guaranteed that if I bought a new Epson printer (which was a fraction of the cost of the new software I had planned to buy) and I didn't like it, I could bring it back for a full refund.  I had nothing to lose, so together we picked out the Epson WF-3540 and I reluctantly took it home fully expecting to be bringing it back to exchange for that expensive software package.<br /><br />This new Epson printer stayed in the box for about a week because I wasn't convinced a new printer was the solution to my problems and I didn't have the time or energy to waste installing it just to prove that sales person wrong.  I finally got it out and and started hooking it up -- *so* easy to do!  Truly, I figured I had to have overlooked something because it was just too easy.  Every computer in the house was immediately able to access this printer on the first try and have stayed connected to it ever since.<br /><br />My first test print was to copy a multi-color document.  It turned out beautiful!  Very clear letters, no blank spots or missing lines at the bottom.  The color was wonderful.  But I was still skeptical.<br /><br />Next, I test printed a picture in my file and it was beautiful as well.  I scanned a new picture without any issue, composed it with my \\""old\\"" photo software, and printed it out.  It printed just as beautiful and with nice, balanced color.  I was certainly softening to this new printer. I decided to give it a few more days to prove itself.<br /><br />I have used it for every day printing for several weeks now.  It does a fantastic job.  Smart little thing, too, as it can scan a document and print it front and back to save paper.  My HP had a document feeder and was supposed to print front and back as well, but it always managed to pull in two or three sheets at a time, or skip some pages somewhere making the feature unreliable and wasteful to use -- not so with this Epson.<br /><br />This Epson has two paper trays which allows me to use both new paper for important documents and pre-used paper for unimportant documents which is convenient.  My HPs have only had one paper tray and I was constantly having to swap paper -- usually after printing an important document on pre-used paper because I wasn't paying attention to what was loaded.  Also, the Epson holds a lot more paper than my HPs have.  I don't have to refill the drawers nearly as often which I didn't consider to be an important feature, but it sure is nice now that I have experienced it.<br /><br />Today I needed to scan in two, 20 page documents to PDF files.  I used the basic software that came with the Epson printer and found myself smiling during the process.  Two months ago it had taken me most of the day to scan a mere 6-page document into a PDF file.  I remember that day and how irritated I was by the end of the process.  If I got one complete scan in before that HP cut me off and gave me an error message I was doing good!  Not so with this Epson.  A simple scan was exactly that: Simple.  Very simple.  The software was very intuitive so I had no problem getting it to scan and save as I desired.<br /><br />Today I also needed to scan in some genealogy pictures first at a low resolution, then again at a higher resolution.  I had been delaying this task because in the past scanning at a higher resolution was rarely possible with my HP.  A few scans into the process, I found myself smiling, laughing, and finally tears of joy as I realized how nice this Epson was to work with.<br /><br />To say I am happy with this Epson is an under statement.  I am absolutely delighted.  I have tears of joy.  Now I need to go back to the store -- I have a sales lady to thank.  :)<br /><br />AS AN UPDATE... I did not use my Epson WF-3540 for a month. When I returned and resumed working with it, the YELLOW and CYAN did not print.  I used the built-in Head Cleaner (Setup>Maintenance>Head Cleaning) and the yellow resumed to about 50%, but the cyan only printed a couple dots.  After using the built-in Head Cleaner numerous times with no further benefit (and even changing the color cartridges with no benefit), I purchased a 4-ounce bottle of PRINT HEAD CLOG BUSTER by Inkmizer(dot)com (they are on Amazon as \\""A Bowl Of Cherries\\"").  The man I spoke to was friendly and knowledgeable and even emailed directions to me.  The product came quickly and with everything necessary.  It was easy to use -- just a few drops on the resting pad, let soak, run the head cleaner, and test print.  The first time I tried this, I let it sit overnight.  In the morning, all of the yellow and most of the cyan was printing again.  I soaked the resting pad a second time letting it sit over the weekend. Come Monday morning all colors were printing beautifully again.  I am sure the problem was caused by my month-long absence which allowed the ink in the heads to dry up.  I would hate for anyone to have the same issue and think the printer was ruined.  This was a quick and inexpensive DIY fix that required no technical expertise.<br /><br />NOTE... I am not a \\""greenvine\\"" user. No one paid me for my review"

1129586,2705976,"Sample Meal Plans. Some of the things covered is cookware, herbs and spices. There is a grocery/pantry list of healthy, healing foods to keep on hand and these are regular foods one can find at most grocery stores. And the foods he lists are great tasting foods!<br />* This chapter has two weeks of sample daily menus and these are mainly fruits and vegetables, nuts, however, seafood and lean meats (smaller servings) are also allowed.<br />I tried this daily plan's guidelines with the fruits, vegetables, nuts and smaller servings of seafoods, lean meats and I was filled up with each meal...lost weight as well, my blood pressure went down as well!<br /><br />4  Chapter 9 Recipes...My favorite chapter! There are recipes for juices, smoothies, Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner. My favorite recipes are: Breakfast Burrito (I like this for a quick and tasty lunch), Veggie Frittata, another one of my lunch favorites, Turkey Avocado Wrap, Coconut Curry Chicken and Brown Rice, Chicken and Vegetable Casserole, Rosemary Baked Chicken (my most favorite), and Stir Fried Chicken with Eggplant and Onion.<br />*Note that I found the above recipes easy to prepare and they tasted wonderful, and best of all, filled me up.<br /><br />5 Table of Contents and Index. I love the index because I like to look up certain things quickly. For example, I love bananas so I looked up bananas in the index...there were 6 recipes with bananas in it.<br /><br />6 The last section of this book has NOTES. This contains (for each chapter), books or research articles for futher reading. The author has indeed fully studied and researched health!<br /><br />In closing, I say that this is now my Go To Book. I believe that anyone interested in improving their health or maintaining their health should have this book in their home.<br /><br />Gene Theraphy Plan (hardcover) was sent to me at no charge"

Lee has the fortune to continually be working at his craft so that he knows that a good book (or ebook for that matter) is more than a good plot with great sounding characters.

Lee Goldberg knows how to tell a story.<br /><br />A police detective put into a \\""hellish\\"" part of the city in the hopes that he will quit (or be killed) which will make the department happy after his whisleblowing got a lot of his deserving comrades in trouble.

I had the hammock tied to two available branches only four feet off the ground, so that the lowest part of me was just a few inches above the ground.<br /><br />I had plenty of room once I was in the hammock, cozy and wrapped up with the excess nylon on either side that works great as a shield from the cool breeze and annoying bugs.  The hammock kept me protected from the wind.  I felt no hot spots or weak seams while lying in this hammock because there is no center seam.  There are two side seams to help deflect body pressure.<br /><br />The hammock is easy to get into and out of (as long as it's not hung up too high).  The rope is long enough to wrap around large branches, too.  When not in use this hammock can be used as a thin blanket or as a body wrap at night by the camp fire, or can be compressed into its own carrying bag that's attached to the hammock.  It dries out quickly, depending on humidity.  The only thing I'd watch for are the conditions of the ropes, as the nylon frays fast.<br /><br />I was sent a free"

And then there is \\""Autumn Colours,\\"" the final tale in this collection.  It takes up some of the same motifs as others, but approaches them in a different way, resulting in a story that is closer to traditionally-defined contemporary literature, and yet has an effect unlike anything else I've ever read.  (It may, from an allusion within the text, bear some similarity to Japanese literature, with which I am woefully unfamiliar.)  It is not a pleasant reading experience, and after first finishing it I wasn't sure the story was a success.  But I now think that was a kind of shrinking away from its truth rather than an honest critical response.  \\""Autumn Colours\\"" is, in its own way, as fine a tale as \\""The Mermaid.\\""<br /><br />This review"

1154803,2822130,"sample the room air and determine if more cooling is needed.\\""<br /><br />I have no idea why the unit's fan has to be running in order to determine it needs to cool. Hello Friedrich!, isn't that what a thermostat / temperature setting is for. The downside is until it needs to cool this darn unit is cycling on/off every 3 minutes. If it determines it does not, it shuts back off in 10-15 seconds.The end result is this unit is constantly turning on and off making it impossible to get to sleep!<br /><br />On the other hand, the dry mode is nice during the day time for keeping the room nice without the need of running the AC in normal mode. A bit of warning... the dry mode DOES NOT = DEHUMIDIFER like some people think.  With a dehumidifier you set the to a desired humidity. This is not the case with this AC; the dry mode is driven by temperature.  All that is really happening is in dry mode, the fan speed is so low (even lower than the lowest cooling speed). With the fan speed so low, it naturally is going to take longer to cool and as result you get more dehumidification. In essence, you could do the same thing on any AC unit by simply turning the fan to it's slowest speed.<br /><br />It's nice the remote displays the temperature. However, the drawback to the remote is the icon's for the different modes are near impossible to see as they are so darn small. I have to open the access door to the on unit controls to see what mode it's actually in. It would have been extremely helpful to have light on LED display.<br /><br />Unlike any AC I have had with a digital temp reading, the thermostat on this unit is dead on with 2 thermometers I placed in the room. Nice to know when you set it to 70 that is exactly what the room temp will get!<br /><br />Installation, is awkward at best. There are 4 screws, 2 in front and 2 in the back of the unit that must be removed in order to slide the chassis out. The chassis is in the cabinet so darn tight, you're going to swear there are more screws holding it in. With the extremely tight fit of the chassis into the cabinet it takes one person holding on to the cabinet while another person  slides the chassis out and even then it's difficult.<br /><br />After two weeks with listening to the what sounds like an out of balance fan, I had Amazon replace the unit. If it exhibits the same noise level, I will send it back to. Personally, I have another 8000 BTU Kenmore in another bedroom that is 1 yr old and I prefer it over the Friedrich for a sleeping environment. I will update my review"

For large messes this means many emptying trips<br />- The two cleaning heads both performed well, just remember to push the red one flat and the other at an angle as shown in the video<br />- Clean up was simple by emptying the tank using the plastic plunger on the top.  I suggest rinsing it with clean water before storage<br />- Wrapping the cords and hose was quick and it was ready to be put away<br /><br />Overall it did a great job of drawing water back out of the carpet but it left it damp. You could see it working hard through the clear tools to suck the water up.  Make sure you point the heads correctly when applying the chemicals to make sure you do not spray it everywhere including on yourself. Mainly with the red nozzle.<br /><br />The power has to be on for you to even spray for some pre-treat work, otherwise for safety the nozzles will not spray any chemicals.

1165045,97516,"sample and send us a link. We are looking at each one of these and trying to make it work.     Planned solution: We are working with multiple users on samples they sent us. We found some issues (either our issue or Intel issue) and working on fixes.     We are committed to make Boxee the best and most versatile player of video files. If it is feasible with our HW we will make it work.     Thumbnail loading, caching  For people with lots of videos the thumbnail loading and caching has been very problematic. It takes long to load and it needs to do it after every reboot.    Planned solution: We are looking into the way we load thumbs. There may be an issue right there. We are also looking for an alternative solution for caching the thumbs (maybe on an SD/USB stick or on the NAND).    We also want to support folder.jpg that users already have rather than going out to the Internets to fetch one.     Subtitle support  We are very proud to be supporting multiple subtitle formats including control of font, size, color and location. Alas some users have reported bugs related to SSA/ASS.     Plus a very annoying bug that make subtitles show by default..    Planned solution: We already fixed the default subtitle behavior and are looking into the issues related to SSA/ASS.    Weak WiFi signal  People reporting weak WiFi signals and in some cases buffering because of it.    Planned solution: First I must admit we have a somewhat embarrassing bug that Boxee shows the strongest WiFi AP as the weakest... Yes, I Know.. as I said, embarrassing. We fixed it. Now we need to find out why some people are having real miserable experience over WiFi. We are looking into it and troubleshooting with multiple users.    So you are \\""working on it\\"". great.. but when should we expect fixes?   We are going to have a first firmware fix out later this week. Fixing support for 1080i TVs (a nasty, nasty bug) and as many other bugs as possible.    The UI fixes are going to take us 2-4 weeks, but otherwise we plan to release updates probably once a week in the short term, and then move to a more sane update schedule.

1166025,1083056,"sample pack of 4 X 6 Canon Plus Glossy II photo paper.  Extricating the printer from its box was par for the course, with the usual removal of protective wrapping and unsticking of orange tape.<br /><br />The printer itself weighs in at 20 lbs, so it is somewhat more hefty than it looks and it is by no means petite at 18.6 x 14.5 x 6.9 inches.  It sports a small view screen and innovative touch panel that functioned smoothly.  It has a pleasing, modern design, and a glossy finish that really looks cool at first, but is a real magnet for fingerprints.<br /><br />SET UP:<br />You hardly need a manual to tell you what to do, as the printer really tells you what to do itself once you turn it on.  The carriage centers as you open the device and placing the print head in place is easy.  The ink cartridges are color coded and fit in place easily.  There is a thick, black cartridge that can only fit in one space, but the color cartridges are otherwise identical.  They will fit into each other's slots, but there is a guide on the print head that makes placement a no brainer.  As each cartridge is equipped with its own microchip, my guess is that the printer would inform you of any errors in placement.  Not wanting to mess up the color printing for the first runs, I stuck with the program and didn't let the machine prime the ink tanks while placed in the wrong slots.  Once closed, the machine quickly cleans the print heads and then prompts you to place the photographic paper in the back loading slot for print head alignment.  A few minutes later, this is done.  Plain paper can then be loaded in the front cassette or in the rear loading slot, and you're off to the races.<br /><br />WARNING!:  A word about the ink tanks--these are a brand new style.  This means that it will be some time before refurbished or third party cartridges are available for use.  Although brand new Canon ink cartridges are likely to function the best, other options do significantly decrease the price per page and not everyone needs 100% full quality prints or an archival photo that will not fade in `300 years.' You can get an idea of ink prices here:  [[ASIN:B003QR87I6 Canon PGI-225 BK/ CLI-226 C,M,Y 4 Pack Value Pack (4530B008)]]; [[ASIN:B003QQYV78 Canon CLI-226 Gray Ink Tank (4550B001)]].  Note that at the time that I am writing this there is no value pack that covers all of the MG6120 inks together.  Unlike other Canon photo printers you will need the PGI-225 black and FOUR CLI-226 cartridges (C,M,Y, and GRAY). At present prices, refilling the ink tanks twice would cost about asmuch as buying a brand new MG6120 at Amazon's sale price.  To my knowledge, no 3rd party refill kits or refurbished cartridges are available at this time.)<br /><br />UPDATE 1/15/2011: Generic inks are now becoming available for the printer.  But so far, caveat emptor.  I purchased these [[ASIN:B004GJB5KU 6 PKS GENERIC INK CANON PGI-225 CLI-226 Pixma iP4820 MG5220]] at a bargain basement price but--as always--there's a catch.  The cartridges do NOT come with cartridge recognition chips--the printer WILL NOT RUN unless the chips are in place.  The instructions tell you how to transfer the chips from your existing OEM cartridges to a plastic device called a 'chip extender.'  Once you understand how to do this it isn't exactly rocket science but lets just say that there's a learning curve here and only 1/6 cartridges were recognized by my printer.  I will be contacting the company and trying to figure out where things went wrong and re-updated the review"

1167662,442142,"sample episodes from other seasons, including a few from the last season (1956-1957), which was the only season that was filmed in color. Clayton Moore played the Lone Ranger for most of the series, but due to a contract dispute, a replacement actor named John Hart played the role in episodes 79-130 (1952-1953).<br /><br />In my opinion, the video and sound quality are surprisingly good, considering the age of the original film and the quality of early TV recordings. The aspect ratio is 4:3, which was the format of the TV sets made in that era. The episodes have an average runtime of 22-23 minutes each, and I think that the run speed may have been increased slightly for these DVDs, since the typical runtime for a half-hour TV show in the 1950s was about 25-26 minutes, plus 4-5 minutes of commercials.<br /><br />I loved watching these old shows that I first watched on TV more than a half-century ago. No, the acting isn't that great, and the production values weren't even close to those of modern TV shows, but it's a fascinating look into the past at one of the earliest successful TV series. The Lone Ranger was the ABC Network's first hit series and helped to establish the network as one of the big three in TV.<br /><br />The DVD is a treasure trove for Lone Ranger fans, and well worth a look for anyone interested in the development of television shows, especially westerns.<br /><br />Note: My review"

He also said he would never buy a coffee maker where he could not get the coffee for it locally.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that's one of the big bugaboos about this De'Longhi coffee machine--apparently the Nescafe Dolce Gusto  capsules are available only online.  An even bigger bugaboo is the small selection of capsules available.  Unlike the Keurig K-Cup system which seems to have unlimited teas and coffees, the Nescafe capsules right now consist of 1 cocoa, 1 cappuccino ice drink, 2 teas, 7 coffees with milk, and 7 dark coffees. That's not much compared to the K-Cups one can buy. Not much at all.<br /><br />I tried the cocoa and very much liked it.  It did not taste like hot Nesquik, but like the Hershey's cocoa we used to make on the stove as kids, only thinner, because water is being used.  That's something to keep in mind, too, if you really like cocoa.  Cocoa made with water is never going to taste as good as cocoa made with real milk. But using this De'Longhi machine is a quick and fun way to make a drink.  I only hope they get a lot more cocoa and tea flavors in the future, and have sample boxes of both.  If not, I'll just be making cocoa with the machine for me, and hopefully coffee that will impress all guests . . . except my brother-in-law, of course. :)<br /><br />Afterthoughts: The September 2014 issue of [[ASIN:B003I7HS3Y Consumer Reports (1-year auto-renewal)]] has an article on \\""pod\\"" coffee makers.

1195528,1579419,"sample set I received has three pairs of regular silicone tips and one flanged pair, all of which fit quite securely on the stem, plus a cord clip and a velveteen pouch. VSonic seems to change the packaging and accessories on their headphones frequently and they may now be shipping with extra tips as a bonus.<br /><br />Between the sound quality and price, these VSonic GR02s are perfect for everyday use, even for audiophiles. Honestly, I am too much of a worry-wart to use expensive earphones when running errands. They are comfortable enough that I forget they're in my ears, they produce very enjoyable sound, and are a true bargain. I think they would also make a much-appreciated gift for anyone who enjoys listening to music with portable devices.<br /><br />VSonic provided earphones for evaluation"

1197753,1406255,"sample video in amv format, so I guess you will need to download software to put your videos in that format with the correct resolution and bitrate.  I remember doing this back in the day with a hacked Nintendo DS, so it is funny to see it in 2015.  With that said, it would be a large nuisance to convert all of your videos to that format, even if you know how.<br /><br />On the bright side, as I said, it has worked fine for what it is so far.  I also like that the micro SD card is removable.  That makes it easy to pop it into a card reader to transfer files, or use for other things.  It is a generic unnamed brand, but works.<br /><br />Overall, I find it difficult to recommend this over an old Android phone that you might find in this price range.  If you go in knowing what it is, though, you might be happy with it, and the older iPod style design makes it easy to hold.<br /><br />Thank you to the company for a review"

If you are \\""wealthy\\"" and this knife set is a 'use and chuck away knife set' then it isn't too bad but if you are like the most of us who are purchasing this knife to keep in your kitchen for a life time (with proper care) then I would NOT recommend this set.

1210928,883784,"sample was good and I thought what do I have to lose - .99?  As usual, I forgot about the time that I invest in reading!  Anyway, A Friendly Arrangement was a quick read, so I didn't lose a lot of time but wish the author had fixed the errors prior to publishing.<br /><br />This is a sweet story of best friends to married couple to lovers.  There wasn't a lot of conflict or drama, which I actually enjoyed (until the silly subplot at the end).  Alex and Samantha have been best friends since they were kids.  Both come from wealthy backgrounds and are alone as Alex lost his parents at a young age and has no other close relatives and Samantha has little to do with her self-centered and many times married parents.  Evidently neither of them have siblings as none are mentioned.  Alex's beloved grandfather dies and his will dictates that Alex must marry within seven days or lose his huge inheritance including the family's spa-resort hotels, which he runs.  Meanwhile, Samantha has just found out that she's pregnant by artificial insemination with donor sperm.  With only seven days to marry, Alex decides to ask his best friend Samantha to marry him temporarily to fulfill the terms of the grandfather's will and get his inheritance.  Samantha agrees to help Alex, so they marry, move in together and begin sharing a bedroom (and a bed but with no sex).  Alex will be the father of her baby (at least on paper) and they plan to stay married for one year.<br /><br />What I liked about the story:<br />-  I'm a fan of the best friends to lovers theme<br />-  Alex and Samantha were both nice, well-adjusted people<br />-  Samantha had a lot of spunk and stood up for herself when she heard an old flame of Alex's talking about her in a restaurant<br /><br />What I didn't like:<br />-  There were quite a few grammatical errors and typos that could easily have been fixed with a read-through by someone conversant in spelling and writing.

A mouse!  Ok, so I was amazed. Yes, with a Bluetooth mouse connected, an arrow icon actually appears on the screen and you can use it pretty much like any mouse on a conventional PC. I'm using the Microsoft Sculpt Touch mouse but any Bluetooth one will work. You can also connect a keyboard at the same time.    8. Limited amount of accessories and ridiculous prices thereof  Because of its newness, there are a limited number of accessories and cases for this tablet. Furthermore, I guess because companies like Zagg and Logitech believe you're willing to overpay for the tablet, they can charge you a premium for accessories. $129 for a keyboard/case? You must be kidding.    9. Amazon video/Flash player:  Streaming video from your Amazon account is almost impossible. I was accustomed to using Amazon's streaming video app on the iPad to watch tv shows and movies I get from Amazon. There is no such app for Android devices.  This is very unlike Amazon and Google (but less so for Adobe) and I wish they would get over themselves and help their customers. BTW, there are no problems watching Netflix, YouTube or Hulu using their respective apps.    10. The guys at Adobe (or someplace) will make sure you can't use this as a notebook replacement  Getting Flash installed on this tablet is an exercise in contortion. It can be done via the installation of an obscure \\""Dolphin\\"" browser, an older version of Adobe Flash and then jimmying with settings to put it all together, but it's complicated especially with this tablet running KitKat. I was successful, but it took a while. I understand this is because of a disagreement between Google (Android's developer), Amazon and Adobe.    11. Amazon (or someone) doesn't want you streaming your library on the Note Pro:  There is no Amazon streaming app as there is for the iPad (see #10 above).  This is very unlike Amazon and Google (but less so for Adobe) and I wish they would get over themselves and help their customers. BTW, there are no problems watching Netflix, YouTube or Hulu using their respective apps.    12. New Charging / sync connector on cord  The Note Pro uses a new Micro USB 3.0 connector. It's wider than the one that THE ENTIRE REST OF THE PLANET USES. You can use an old-style Micro USB charger, but it takes much longer to charge it than if you use the cord that comes with it. Also, there are no USB 3.0 car chargers (that I've been able to find, anyways). ALSO ALl those zillions of USB chargers you own? Many of them won't charge the Galaxy Note Pro.    13.

The flexball is supposed to enable the blades to pivot back and side to side to respond to the contours of the face. It reminds of the ball feature in most new vacuum cleaners today that enhance maneuverability.<br /><br />I tested the razor under multiple conditions over the past three weeks: 1 day shave, 3 day shave, and 1 week shave. It passed all three tests seamlessly. The first time that I used the Flexball out of the box, my shave was so effortless that I was in awe. The combination of the lubristrips and flexball allowed the razor to glide across my face. I didn’t feel a thing and was done in record speed.<br /><br />I found the flexball to be effective in responding to the contours of my face while staying close to the skin. In particular, it was more effective below my nose and along my jawline, which is area where I often have missed hairs. The ergonomic design of the handle made it easy to grip. The microcomb lifted the hairs up and guide them in a uniform direction for a closer cut. The lubristrip allowed for smooth strokes and as a result, the razor was gliding effortlessly.

1229628,1125715,"Sample journal pages are given to that end.<br /><br />Various beauty products, claims, etc. are not discussed. Instead, Grigore provides information on natural alternatives and pitches a few of her own products for you to buy as well. The product placement isn't as egregious as I've seen in other diet/health books but it should be noted that the author is telling you not to buy products but then is selling products as well. But she does give a recipe for common beauty products including hair, protein conditioner, makeup remover, scrubs, bath soaks, etc. The recipes are fairly simple, most calling for the same 1-2 ingredients (e.g. shea butter and coconut butter). Almost all of these recipes can easily be found online, however.<br /><br />My copy was 150 pages or so - fairly thin. I felt that lack most in the missing discussions on specifics such as age (e.g., teen regimen vs a grandmother's skin care needs). As well, the author will discuss how environment effects skin but then only talk about humid or hot areas briefly and completely leave out e.g., cold areas. Or the drying effect of indoor heated homes in Winter. Everything felt like it was just being glossed over and I kept wishing there had been more on each subject.<br /><br />Reading from cover to back took me all of 1-1/2 hours. It is a very quick read. But other than getting a few recipes I could have googled, I didn't feel that I had learned all that much about skin that I didn't know already.  The book pretty much breaks down into the statement that skin types don't matter, oily or dry don't matter, even all the talk of genetics and environment don't matter. In essence, fix all skin issues by: 1) eating healthy; 2) use natural alternatives to all your beauty products.<br /><br />The book isn't graphical and there are a few crude cartoon-like illustrations but that's it. I would have loved to see some photographs of the recipes for the natural ingredients as well as a much more interesting presentation. A book this short could look a lot less like a manual.<br /><br />So, although friendly and topical, I ended the book feeling like there should have been a lot more/I didn't learn much. That isn't to say that the information presented isn't correct and that we shouldn't strive to eat much better, of course.  Review"

After doing this, I found myself regretting my purchase and migrating towards the higher end Bose speakers--not the Bose Bluetooth speakers.  As far as Bluetooth goes, I would still prefer this speaker over the Bose Soundlink II and I would still say that it is one of the very best if you are needing portability--maybe even the best.  I find that I'm usually using my bluetooth speaker near a wall plug, so I didn't shy away from theunits that had to be plugged in and that didn't have batteries.  If you are looking around and you are in a similar situation where you don't usually need a speaker to operate on a battery, I would suggest going to BestBuy and hearing for yourself.  Everyone has different tastes when it comes to sound and sound is really subjective.  I am not a Bose hater like some.  I am very picky about sound and am willing to pay to get something good that I will be happy with for years.  There were two different speakers at BestBuy that really caught my attention.  One was the Bose Soundlink Air and the other was the even more impressive Bose Soundock 10.  The Bose Soundlink Air is an Airplay speaker that must be plugged in unless you buy the optional battery.  It had the true Bose sound that the Soundlink II didn't in my opinion.  It's sound was clear and had pretty good base.  However, once hearing the Soundock 10, I couldn't go with anything else.  I have two Bose Companion 2.1 computer speakers and they are incredible due to the large heavy subwoofer that powers the set.  I really wanted something that could provide the kind of base and clarity that they did but was portable.  The Soundock 10 provided the closest answer to my needs.  The Soundock 10 has a 7\\"" subwoofer built into it and has the clear highs of the better Bose speakers.  Unfortunately, there is no battery option for the Soundock 10.

Before actually tasting them I took a photo of the samples side-by-side under the same lighting. Note that the Hellman’s mayo is very slightly more yellow in color. This is apparent when looking at the product inside the jar as well.<br /><br />Here are the taste results: combining the results of 3 tests, the Hellman’s was VERY slightly more tangy, which I identified as a little more of a lemon taste. They do not taste the same! It’s not an earth-shaking difference, mind you, but the difference is enough to notice. Neither tasted “better” (and I realize most people don’t eat their mayo from the tip of a spoon). But the taste is not identical. Now, you are probably dying to know how they both compared to Kraft Mayo (which is the brand I reluctantly use these days). Okay, I have never “loved” Kraft Mayo. I buy it because it’s cheaper and for the reason discussed below. Compared to both Best Foods and Hellman’s the Kraft Mayo tastes a little more of eggs, but it also tastes a little more of a very slight chemical flavor. I can only describe it as not tasting as “pure”. It is my least favorite of the three.r />To prepare for the taste test I bought a jar of Best Foods mayo at my local store. I approached the taste test as seriously as any food or beverage tester would approach any test and the results are as fair as I could possibly make them in my home kitchen.<br /><br />For the purpose of this review"

These are the kinds of things I'd never expect to see in a top-quality US-made instrument. However, the instrument more than holds up with others in its price class, including US-made Fenders (my Variax is the Korean-made one, not the US-made one, which I have not seen). The weight is a bit less than a good Les Paul (there is a LOT of wood routed out for the electronics, so it's similar to a chambered Les Paul in weight and sound). The neck is pretty chunky, like a 50s Les Paul neck. Just the way I like it.<br /><br />The guitar plays, handles and balances very very well. The action and setup were spot-on when it arrived. I only needed the tiniest neck adjustment after a few weeks (totally to be expected in a mahogany instrument that moves to a new climate), and I raised the action just a smidge (I like my action higher than many). The fretwork is outstanding, the neck is totally straight and level, and the quality of the hardware seems to be rock solid. There have been some reports of the knobs and switches giving problems on early units, but I waited a year after they came out, and my instrument has no issues with any of those things. (I will admit, however, that I think the knobs are butt-ugly up close, but look fine from normal distance.<br /><br />The VDI cable is a minor pain to plug in (you really can't strap on and then plug in, the guitar gets in the way of itself and you have to open a \\""door\\"" and then plug in the VDI cable), but once you have itplugged in, you're good to go. With the HD 500 this is a REVELATION in tweakability and sound variation. Running the Workbench software will probably be necessary for anybody, as I had to equal out the levels of the different models (to my taste) and raise them to match the volume of the magnetics (which I lowered a lot... because I like my pickups low off the strings.) Also, with the Workbench software, you can create any pickup combo you can imagine (as long as it's only two pickups, you can't do three or more). two humbuckers in the exact same spot? no problem. A lipstick pickup and a Filtertron at odd angles out of phase on a hollow-body Jazz box? No problem... I think this might be a cool guitar for somebody experimenting with odd sound combos to figure out if they want to buy a specific guitar. I think the sound combinations on this guitar might be nearly infinite, but most of us will go with the tried and true.<br /><br />One small thing. I am a guy that likes the pole pieces on my neck pickup \\""out\\"" a bit and the ones on my bridge pickup \\""in\\"" a teeny bit. Somebody at Line6 must agree with me, because that's how my guitar arrived, which is nice, because the pole pieces on the pickups seem VERY stiff compared to other guitars, and I appreciate not having to adjust them.<br /><br />Lastly, some have reported an issue with \\""palm-muting\\"" strings, and indeed, when you palm mute on this guitar (when using the modeling sounds) you have to adjust how you do it, because it responds differently than regular magnetic pickups, especially with very high-gain sounds. I don't use those high-gain sounds and can report that I have very little trouble with this issue on the electric sounds, but a little bit on the acoustic sounds, where I find I need to adjust more. Line 6 is apparently improving this for the next update, but even without that update, I am still satisfied with the way this works on my guitar. You should definitely check this guitar out in person if you can and see if this issue is one that does or doesn't affect you and your playing style.<br /><br />I can't highly recommend this product enough!<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was a Line6 endorsee... however, this does NOT mean I got anything for free"

1269623,2137495,"sample to see if I have better luck, but one poster on the Dell forums experienced uneven luminance on six samples of the U2715H. Not a good sign.<br /><br />Dell's policy regarding backlight uniformity is as follows (from the Dell monitor forum FAQs): &#34;Dell monitors do not have 100% backlight uniformity specification. As long as the center 4&#34; circle (7&#34; circle for 27&#34; and larger monitors) meets our manufacturer specifications, it is acceptable.&#34; I don't know if this is common in the industry, but this allows for quite non-uniform luminance on the sides of the screen.<br /><br />The second issue with my monitor may not be the fault of the monitor, but I have seen a few other comments about this. I'm including this in case anyone else has experienced it. The monitor comes with a mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable. When I connected the mini DP end to the monitor and the DP end to my graphics card (an ASUS GTX 970 Strix), the monitor at first wouldn't recognize the presence of a signal. This happened with several attempts at reconnecting the cable and rebooting. When I connected the monitor with an HDMI cable, everything worked fine. I reconnected the DP cable and the monitor eventually recognized it. (You need to manually select thecorrect input in the monitor's on-screen settings, and it stores settings separately for each input.) It worked fine for awhile, but occasionally the monitor wouldn't sense a video signal on system boot requiring several attempts to connect. This only occurred at boot, and if the video signal was recognized it remained connected for the duration of the session.<br /><br />I've ordered a new DisplayPort cable to see if the included cable is bad. In the meantime, I'm using HDMI which still allows the display of the monitor's full 2560 x 1440 native resolution.<br /><br />In all other respects, the monitor is quite good. The pixel density is perfect for a 27-inch monitor. Type is very crisp and not too small. The monitor is nice looking with a solid stand. The touch sensitive buttons are a bit of a pain to operate at first until you get the hang of it. The IPS glow is very present, as it is with most IPS monitors. I don't find this to be an issue for most images, but you can clearly see it if you're watching anything in letterbox format, for example.<br /><br />The poor luminance uniformity, however, has made me deduct two stars from my review"

The TV shows are not nearly as scary as [[ASIN:0143039989 The Haunting of Hill House]]-- and this book isn't scary either though it does have some gore.  It doesn't adequately exploit the possibilities of the set up.  After all oleander is one of the most poisonous plants in the world.<br /><br />I started out thinking in dismay I was reading a gay version of a 1984 Silhouette Desire-- New assistant falls for hawt married boss. There's also a witchy stereotypical psychic foisted on them by the owner of Oleander House.  But soon even the conflict that was brought by the witchy psychic is dealt with and the only thing going is the sexual identity conflict and some psychic events.<br /><br />I also had some trouble trying to figure out exactly what position the characters were in while having sexual dreams.  I finally gave up on that.<br /><br />Finally, this was my first experience of a m/m ebook.

I think I prefer books like Gina Hale's [[ASIN:0978986113 Wicked Gentlemen]] to this.  However, I am curious enough to try the second in the series if I can get someone to assure me that it resolves the plot threads left hanging at the end of this one-- other than the relationship one-- it's a romance, I know how that will end.<br /><br />One big plus, the price is right on the downloads for the Kindle from the publisher-- as I stated this one was a free"

1288530,1168582,"sample from Wright's book, \\""What Saint Paul Really Said,\\"" to give the reader a glimpse of the unusual and off-centered nature of his teaching:<br /><br />\\""Many Christians, both in the Reformation and in the counter-Reformation traditions, have done themselves and the church a great disservice by treating the doctrine of `justification' as central to their debates, and by supposing that it described the system by which people attained salvation.\\""<br /><br />Beasley divides his critique of NT Wright's teaching into four parts:<br /><br />1. A Lexical Analysis. Beasley contends Wright's use of the phrase \\""the righteousness of God\\"" and \\""justification\\"" both fail to pass the test of a careful study of the word \\""righteousness\\"" in the original languages, both OT and NT, from a background and semantic sense.<br /><br />2. The Forensic (Judicial) Context: Tests Wright's understanding of God's judicial application as it relates to justification of the sinner.<br /><br />3. Paul's Apostleship: Tests Wright's assertions concerning Paul's pedigree as a Pharisee and what, if any, impact it had on his NT writings.<br /><br />4. The Whole Counsel of God: Tests Wright's writings on the doctrine of justification against the whole of revealed scripture.<br /><br />With a solid game plan in hand, Beasley painstakingly applies each of his four tests to Wright's contention that the phrase \\""the righteousness of God\\"" and His justification of the sinner has been misinterpreted and is therefore misunderstood by much of Christendom today. He insists that in it's essential understanding \\""...the righteousness of God would have one obvious meaning: God's own faithfulness to his promises, to the covenant.\\"" Whereas Wright extensively uses extra-biblical sources and traditions to prop up his retooling of Paul's message, Beasley spends four chapters carefully applying his 4-point argument, pointing out exactly where Wright has erred, where he has deviated from the truth and at the same time constructing a compelling biblical case. After placing Paul's biblical message side-by-side with Wright's less than biblical evidence, Beasley makes it clear to the reader exactly what the Apostle Paul \\""really said,\\"" especially when compared to Wright's extra-biblical and ecumenically-driven version.<br /><br />This is a detailed, theological book, yet is still not out of reach of the interested reader. I'm convinced it would be a disservice to the author and the reader if I perused every nuance of Beasley's position, describing in any detail the arguments spelled out this book. Each reader must do that for themselves. But I can say this, Beasley's 149-page book is loaded with easy to follow biblical exegesis, footnotes on the page referenced (my favorite kind of citing), and an outstanding 5-part Appendix that will engage and satisfy the student of this essential doctrine of the Christian faith.<br /><br />One aspect of Beasley's book that I found exceptional was the fact that prior to publication he actually provided Wright, an Anglican theologian, with a transcript of the book, requesting Wright share his observations and a critique of \\""Indeed, has Paul Really Said?\\"" I would think one would have to be pretty confident of the accuracy of your research and the strength of argument to do that. Even more surprising, NT Wright did actually respond back with a brief response. As it turned out, the addition of Wright's critique only strengthened and enhanced Beasley's book all the more. I enjoyed this book immensely, especially Pastor Beasley's meticulous approach to pealing back the veneer covering Wright's \\""New\\"" view of Paul, examining its nuances, and then with resolute commitment to the truth provided his own analysis. No \\""straw-man\\"" arguments here.<br /><br />Wrapping up his analysis of NT Wright's book, Pastor Beasley includes these words:<br /><br />\\""With all of this we are reminded that what is at stake is the Gospel itself, and when men obfuscate the Gospel we must be careful to expose such obfuscation and refute it. I must contend that a man who is willing to sideline the bodily resurrection of Christ, as a non-essential, should not be so free"

1297486,2418077,"sample of the cream was really important for me before I would commit to purchasing such an expensive product.  The little jar holds a bit less than .05 oz of the cream but with this product a little goes a long way. I have really oily skin and suffer from break outs and wrinkles (what a combo) so I was a little bit afraid that the cream would break me out.  I used a pea size amount on the drier parts of my skin to see if I would break out.  I am happy to say that the cream did not break me out.  I was also surprised at how smooth the texture of the cream is. It spread out so easily so a little really went a long way.  I got about three weeks worth of use out of this little jar. That was enough time to get a good idea of its effectiveness for my skin.<br /><br />The cream is great and really moisturized my skin.  I found it a bit too heavy to use during the day since it has been really warm out here this summer.  I decided to use it only at night and got some great results.  I think this cream will be wonderful during the winter when my skin tends to be drier.<br /><br />According to the BzzAgent website the &#34; SK-II Essential Power Cream contains Stem-Acanax and Pitera™ to radically improve firmness and reduce wrinkles&#34;.  This miracle ingredient is at the core of the revolutionary products SK-II offers. SK-II Facial Treatment Essence is a liquid concentrate with 90% Pitera™ in every bottle. SK-II Facial Treatment Masks deliver an indulgent concentration of Pitera™ in a single application. Your future isn’t limited by your DNA. With the right regimen, you can change your skin’s destiny.<br /><br />The Pitera compound stimulates the skins natural cellular repair and promotes more efficient skin regeneration.  For those who do not know, Pitera is a type of fermented yeast that is supposed to speed up the skins rejuvenation process.  The yeast come from Saki.<br /><br />Overall, the price of these products may appear to be on the high side.  However, if you consider how well they work and how little of the product you use at each application, then the price is actually pretty reasonable.<br /><br />Thank you to BzzAgent and SK II for providing me with samples of these products to test out and give my honest review"

I wrote<br />back when offered, &#34;I don't want it if it is a stimulant, something with caffeine, something that revs me up....because I am already too sensitive  and I have ADD.  I am trying to calm down, not unbalance myself.  It also has to be truly natural, nothing artificial.&#34;<br />I was promised that Dr. Elisabeth's Forskolin met my criteria.<br />  I've been using it about 3 weeks now.  She was right about not revving me up.  At first, I wondered if it was even doing anything<br />at all.  Except for the fact, that my cravings for junky food (you know the stuff), seemed to just wane away.  I also noted a subtle, but<br />positive leaning towards wanting healthy stuff.  I was drawn to eating two whole pints of blueberries a day....fresh from the container.<br />  I received the  advise encouraging me to view the video:  www.cerealkillersmovie.com which I liked and purchased.<br />I was also encouraged to get a book called Nourishing Traditions which I purchased, and have only briefly scanned so far.<br />  Nevertheless, I continuously began to drop weight in these last weeks.  I was stuck in the 205-210 range for about 10 years.<br />Nothing I tried seemed to lower it.  Like an emotional wedge, I was stranded in that range.<br />  Amazingly, since using the Forskolin daily, just one capsule a day, the weight has started to leave.  I got down to l94...a number I've not seen in years.  I plan to continue using this product.  Its not a sledge hammer.  It is gentle, subtle and seems to have<br />a quiet way of regulating and balancing your system.  I had my BP checked at the doctor's office yesterday and it was 107 over 85,<br />nice and low. I've been on blood pressure medicine for about 3 years.  This is the lowest reading I can recall. I am 66 and want to<br />be healthy a good long time.<br />  I was prepared not to like this, to find it relatively useless, like other things I've tried, but joyfully, so far so good!  I'll report<br />back in due time with further updates.  As I said, its only been about 3 weeks and I have much more weight to lose.  But I feel con-fident that Forskolin is giving my body something healthy it seems to need and want.  Quietly, without fanfare, I am looking better in<br />my clothes, and feel happier in my skin.  No ugly side effects, either.  It also affordable.  I can't make this choice for you, but I'm<br />happy to report I've made it for me.  When my free"

1307806,1254830,"sample songs (this is in addition to the songs already present on the device), as well as an installer for the transfer software.  Once the software is installed on your computer, you can point it to one or more specific directories to \\""watch\\"". Any supported audio files found in these directories will be transferred (via Ethernet or, more simply, 802.11b/g/n wifi) to the HAP-S1. Thereafter, the software watches the directories for changes, and when new audio is added, it's automatically copied over. It's not all great though, and I'm hoping for eventual updates to resolve some of the annoyances.  For example, the list of transferred files is just a text file, and that file determines which music files have already been copied over. The software goes through this text file and ignores anything listed in it.  It's pretty inefficient, and if you want to mark a directory for the software to reload, you have to find the entries in the text file for every file under that directory and manually delete them.<br /><br />Transfer times seemed reasonably quick to me -- it transferred about 5,500 files to the unit in the time it took me to go out to lunch and come back. Actually making those files usable, however... that took quite a bit longer.  It seems that after the file is transferred and the PC transfer software claims success, a database update needs to take place on the HAP-S1 before the files are usable.  Not knowing this, I thought that a large number of my FLACs were not being read -- the directories were there but showed zero files -- but after a while they started to show up.  I haven't found a single file that the player couldn't deal with.<br /><br />The HAP-S1 is also available from your PC desktop as a NAS drive, so if you like you can skip the auto-transfer software and just drag-and-drop your files directly into it. Unfortunately (here's another suggestion for a firmware update) this connection doesn't reset the standby timer. So if you're messing around in the filesystem with the unit mounted as a drive, at some point you'll lose your connection to it because it doesn't think it's being used and it goes into standby mode.<br /><br />Personally, I set the software to watch two directories. It watches my iTunes directory as well as a sister directory for all non-iTunes files. When there are duplicates, I manually delete the duplicate from the HAP-S1, and since it still shows up in that silly text file, it won't attempt to re-copy it later.<br /><br />Included Remote:<br /><br />Nearly useless, only the most basic controls: Power, volume, prev/next/pause, mute. It has the exact same finish as the HAP-S1 itself, and feels good in the hand.  But to be honest, you'll almost never use it, instead favoring one of the mobile remote options.<br /><br />Mobile Remote:<br /><br />As of today, remotes are available for Android and Apple devices. I've used it on an iPhone and an iPad, and both formats look great. I've added a couple of screenshots from the iPad, which is my preferred remote. Numerous sorting and filtering options are available, and you can search as well.  Operation is quick and smooth, and the background colors fade and shift to match the predominant colors in the album art (a feature also present on the screen of the unit itself, a very nice touch). Many features are available in the remote including basic EQ, a sleep timer, DSEE defeat, and more.  Overall, it's a beautiful and slick user interface that's comfortable and easy on the eyes.<br /><br />Music Options:<br /><br />The HAP-S1 has a series of \\""SensMe\\"" channels (Morning, Upbeat, Emotional, Energetic, and a host of others, 13 total) based on what the songs \\""look like\\"".  It's generally pretty accurate, but undoubtedly you'll find a few that don't fit -- I was listening to the \\""Morning\\"" channel this morning, and before I'd had my coffee I needed to skip over the Smashing Pumpkins track that popped up.  And I was curious about what it would have included in the \\""Dance\\"" channel since I have very little that would apply there. Some were valid, but \\""Until It Sleeps\\"" by Metallica seemed a questionable choice.  I guess if you have limited viable options for a given channel it needs to stretch the definition a bit.  It's a neat feature though, and it looks like it attempts to find a place for just about everything. Each of the 13 channels has between 150 and 1100 songs on my system.<br /><br />You can also mark favorites, create playlists, browse by genre, artist, album, or track, and search.  You can browse the file system itself to find a track you want. You can even mark \\""anti-favorites\\"". By tapping this button on a track, it will never be played (i.e., if you play the album it's on, it will always skip that track) unless you specifically play that track or turn off the anti-favorite.<br /><br />In addition to the music you've transferred over, there are a couple of other listening options.  There's an Internet Radio section, which as of this review"

1315229,3451421,"Free Product<br />There is so much to love about the Green Toys brand.<br />I think it is incredibly cool that these toys are made of recycled milk jugs. Just as a side, I wish they told me how many.<br />The recommended age for these is 2 and up, but my one year old loves it. My guess is the 2 up recommendation is based on the bear figure, as it could be a choking hazard, but it’s pretty big so I’m not concerned about that. I think these are more suited for a young child than a Tonka truck as the plastic is soft and all of the edges are rounded, so you don’t have any sharp edges. Also, because this is plastic you can play with it in the water or get it dirty and easily wash it, even in the top rack of the dishwasher, and you don’t have worry about rust or paint chipping.<br />My daughter (3) immediately decided that this was “my Snort”, a reference to the “Are You My Mother?” book. So, this toy spends a lot of time putting the baby bird back in the tree. This is my favorite of the three toys in this set. We push things, we lift things and we dump things. Wonderful.<br />I know review"

I know Martin Brest is a capable--if not great--director (he helmed \\""Scent of a Woman.\\""), but the way he tracks over JLo's body as she relates her experiences makes me think he came to this project straight from adult films. Despite all the sexual content, the film is desperately unerotic, probably due to the fact that we A: do not care about these characters, and B: they have absolutely no redeeming features. That's pretty much all you need to know, as further detail would simply be beating a dead horse.

Convinced the only thing left to do would be to shut the robot down permanently, Tenma inadvertently crushes the robot's will and causes his decision to run away from home.<br /><br />Only after ending up on the junk-pile surface of the planet and being taken in by a ragtag group of young humans can Toby discover the true capabilities of his new body and the potential within that transforms him from the mere memory of Toby Tenma into the hero Astro.<br /><br />The scope of the film is marvelous through and through with direction that captures the subtle tragedy on which this franchise is based without discounting the action-heavy segments laced throughout.  Legit comparisons can be made to tales like Edward Scissorhands and Pinocchio in terms of emotional depth/ connection without ever sacrificing its own originality.<br /><br />Some fans of the earlier animated efforts have voiced concern over deviations made from the source material but I am a subscriber to the theory that it's almost requisite to view this piece as a stand-alone effort as the vast majority of today's movie going target audience would be too young to rememberearlier incarnations, not to mention the writers have had to condense a tale some 58-years in the making into 94-minutes.  All factors considering, Imagi does a wonderful job in capturing the charm and timelessness of the franchise.<br /><br />About my only complaint to report in an otherwise glowing review"

So, if one is \\""compressing\\"" the dpi of this image by cutting it in half (300dpi to 150dpi), then why in the world does this program output a file that is nearly 2.5 times as large?  I actually had a few examples were increased in size tenfold using the same defaults!  This makes no sense, and this flaw would apply to any document that contains graphics -- not just graphics files themselves.  True, one can go into the settings, create and name a new default compression ratio and experiment away, but as slick as this UI is, and as intuitive as it seems to be, why require such fiddling?  I thus moved on to other file types.<br /><br />I ran into no major problems converting OpenOffice text (Writer; .odt) docs to PDFs through the interface, but trying to convert OpenOffice spreadsheets (Calc; .odf and .ods) created really ugly formatting problems with gaps between cells, unfilled voids, and formatting errors, most notably not centering the document but, instead, smashing it up against the top and corner of the \\""page.\\""  I could find no ways to influence the formatting of OpenOffice spreadsheets, and since that program itself outputs to PDFs much more reliably (big improvements in their later releases), there's really no use for Corel's product there.<br /><br />After seeing these two file-types so mangled in final PDF docs, I had seen enough.  However....<br /><br />I am impressed that Corel went so far as to offer encryption and security settings on converted PDF docs (that must have taken some negotiating with Adobe), but the fact that there is no scanner/TWAIN interface to allow continuous scanning and appending of pages to scanned docs (you'd have to scan them all as images and then fiddle with the compression settings and merge the lot manually or by batch), let alone allowing the creation of searchable PDFs, this program proved itself to be of little utility to me.

Then comes \\""You Don't Have to Worry\\"" written by P. Diddy, Heavy D and the boys from 112.  They give NE a different feel on this song and they work it well also contains a sample from the James Brown song \\""Your Love\\"" vocals by Bobby and rap by Ronnie and Mike.  \\""Tighten It Up\\"" is worked on nicely by Jermaine Dupri also written by him along with Ricky Bell and a rap verse by Ronnie and Mike with vocals by Bobby, Ricky and Ralph.  \\""Shop Around\\"" is basically about a guy wanting to go have a look around when it comes to getting with a woman and its cool.  because they handle the song well written again by JD along with Johnny, Ralph and Michael with vocals by Johnny, Ralph, Ricky and Bobby.  \\""Hear Me Out\\"" is a slow burner about him apologizing for hurting the woman that he's with because of what he did.  Its written by Dinky Bingham, Geo Washington and Mike Bivins with vocals by Mike (spoken), Ricky, Johnny, Bobby and Ralph.<br /><br />\\""Something About You\\"" is a cool song (although not really one of my favs on the album) but its written by Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis with Lead vocals by Ralph and Bobby also contains a sample from Edie Brickell's song \\""What I Am\\"" with vocals by Ralph.  \\""Try Again\\"" is more uptempo song than previous efforts and i find myself enjoying more each time i listen to it.  Has a sample from the Slick Rick song \\""Lick the Balls\\"" and written by P. Diddy, Chucky Thompson and Harvey Frierson.  Its about wanting to restart a relationship with someone you've moved on from in the past with vocals by Bobby, Ricky and Ralph.  \\""How Do Like Your Love Served\\"" asks the upfront question of how do you want to be pleased that's how i took it and it's written by Gerald Levert and Edwin Nicholas.  Its another strong slow jam for me from the guys vocals by Ronnie (spoken), Ricky, Johnny and Ralph.  Then comes one of my favorite New Edition songs since \\""Can You Stand the Rain\\"".  \\""One More Day\\"" we all know what the song is about.  its wanting to spend another moment with that special someone that you don't want to leave.  Its written rather nicely by Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis (once again) and Lead Vocals by Ricky along with Ralph as well.  The video is nice as well nothing over the top or anything.  \\""I'm Still In Love With You\\"" another slow song that is right in there with other of my favorite songs.  Written by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis we have Ricky and Ralph handling the lead vocal reins on this song as well with great results.  Its just about a person being in love with someone despite them not being together and that those feelings won't fade away no matter how much time passes by.<br /><br />I'm not really big on Interludes on albums for the most part they do nothing for me.  But \\""Thank You (The JG Interlude)\\"" is done well and its all handled with class and precision by Johnny Gill (one more reason why New Edition is and will always be one of the best groups out there).  He's giving thanks for all the blessings and rewards that he and the group have achieved together over the years.  the last song \\""Home Again\\"" does just that bringing everything home and back to where it started for the group it shows how they've grown over the years and continue to even now vocals by Ralph, Bobby, Johnny, Ricky and Mike (spoken).<br /><br />Its a fitting end song to altogether great CD from my favorite group out there.

The regular (paid) version offers information on over 350 different restaurant chains, and is not limited to McDonalds, Burger King and such. You want information on the menu offerings from chains such as Olive Garden? You'll find it here.<br /><br />Looking up things like Olive Garden's Herb-Grilled Salmon salad told me that it had 510 calories per serving, along with the info on fat, cholesterol, carbs, protein and more. Didn't realize that Uno's Chicago Classic Pizza had a sodium count of 1550 mg, but I know now. And it was interesting to do a breakdown on Chipotle's burritos to figure out whether adding their guacamole was going to make me feel like I was going to overdo it calorie wise, and at 150 calories, I'll deal with it. But my favorite Bacon Cheeseburger from Five Guys kicks in at 920 calories, which means that I'll have to think twice about ordering their large fries at 1474 calories.<br /><br />Likes:<br /><br />+ Excellent selection of restaurant offerings; not just limited to fast food chains<br />+ Good listings of nutritional data: calories, fats, trans fats, cholesterol, sodium, carbs, sugars, protein, etc.<br />+ Ability to search for a restaurant name; not limited to scrolling through all of the icons<br />+ Can add and save a restaurant to favorites; speeds up access<br />+ Good 'scrolling' spreadsheet layout; easy to read info (in landscape mode)<br /><br />Dislikes:<br /><br />- Clunky user interface; kludgy navigation that can be difficult at times<br /><br />As much as I like this app and consider it very useful, the interface, at least on the Kindle Fire, leaves a lot to be desired, as this app could make better use of the Kindle Fire's built-in controls.

It's not really worth your time.<br /><br />This blanded-down version of the Cinderella tale is based upon what is generally-agreed upon as the definitive \\""first\\"" Cinderella, which is by a French author named Charles Perrault, printed in 1697.  What is added here is a bunch of \\""lessons\\"" which children should learn by the story.  For example, when Cinderella is late leaving the ball, thus necessitating her walking home in rags, the author tells his readers: \\""[This] is an everlasting lesson to all the pretty little Cinderellas in the world to keep their word, and to act in good faith by such as befriend them.\\""<br /><br />The best Cinderella for my money is still the Brothers Grimm version, first printed in 1812 and revised in 1819, where Cinderella's evil step-sisters end up cutting off their own toes with a knife to try and force their feet into the glass slipper, and for good measure have their eyes pecked out by birds in the end.  Gotta love those blood-thirsty Grimm Brothers.  In this sugary version, Cinderella is so good that she gags you, and the step-sisters have no come-uppance at all.<br /><br />You can find both the original Perrault version of Cinderella, and the darker Brothers Grimm version, on the Internet for free"

This is also good if one wishes to keep some on hand for anyone who is in need of replacing a badge reel in case of an emergency.<br /><br />As far as quality, at first I didn't think it was all that good.

Even though we sneer at him for wanting to kill Damian, it is very clear that he is not beyond redemption.    The one stumbling point that I found with this novel was the prophesy itself. I found it to be a little bit unformed and vague and convenient. Of course, it is very possible that Ms. Ashley created it this way purposely to inject magic into the story; it is mostly just a fairy tale that the Prince's advisor dug up in order to help him win over his people and claim his throne.

The image quality is poor beyond description--noise, lack of detail, unpleasant \\""smeared\\"" quality--I can't even fathom how it got manufactured by a major company in this day and age. My Samsung phone takes much better shots. Strangely, the quality of the videos is very impressive. Extremely detailed, clear, and it can zoom while shooting. If it were being sold as a video camera that can also take crappy snapshots for reference, maybe this would be an okay product; but as an all-purpose camera it fails dismally, especially at the listed price.

As it is, I will often push on and read to the end of the chapter if I am close. Since none of the ebooks (8) I have bought use this feature, you never know where the end of a chapter is without flipping through the pages, which while not that time consuming, it isn't as easy to do as with a real book.    The dictionary feature was a huge selling point to me and I have not been disappointed. Moving the cursor to the word in question can be a bit awkward since there is some delay using the 5 direction button, but it's not so awkward as to not use the feature.

1419444,3436474,"sample and I was in love. The story telling style of Cherry Gregory is simple, captivating, powerful without the big words and fancy jargon of your usual novelist, and truly compelling. I just finished reading pages in Wikipedia about the Trojan War, thanks to the author inspiring me to learn more about that particular part of history - or Greek Mythology, apparently, there is a debate as to whether this war actually happened. This is my very first introduction into Greek Mythology and I am fascinated!!<br /><br />I have to admit to my temporary disappointment: When the story didn't finish in this book, about which I started having a suspicion when 85% into the book, there had been no talk of the Trojan horse and any of those plans, I was just a bit miffed. What? There is another book?? I did not realize there was a sequel, which I've downloaded and will read today, so both a disappointment and a good surprise in that there is more to read by the author.<br /><br />This is the first novel by this author and just like Smith's &#34;I Am Livia&#34;, her story telling and writing voice and knowledge of the Greek mythology are remarkable. I love discovering new authors who are venturing into historical fiction and the novel writing scene, and using the voice of a powerful female to depict ancient tales of war, romance, and mystique!<br /><br />The narrator is Neomene, the sister of Odysseus who finds herself on the way to Troy to keep her brother company during the decade long Trojan-Greek war. My favorite scenes are between the female character: Neomene, Helen of Troy (although very brief), Elissa, Lo, and Goddess in Mountain of Ida. I love learning about Greek Mythology through the story telling and the author does this so well. I can't think of anything I didn't like in this book and I must warp this review"

1423892,617452,"sample HP INK cartridge since it runs out of ink quickly.  If you think about it the HP cartridges that show 2.5 times more INK are the same size as the regular cartridges.  You then have to ask, \\""how much ink do they really put in the regular OVER priced HP INK cartridges\\""?  I considered myself cheated when I bought the regular sized cartridge.  My personal opinion is that the HP 2.5 times more INK cartridges run out after printing only about 50% more than the regular overpriced HP INK cartridges while you end up paying a lot more.<br />The only good thing about my experience with the Best Buy store is that I was able to try out the HP INK supply and the printers' performance!  I could suggest doing the same but I won't.  I will state that I wasn't shy returning the HP printer to the Best Buy store because I was not afraid of this chain store and I was not satisfied with the performance of the HP Printer.  Best Buy says you have 30 days to return the HP Printer you should have 30 days but this is a misnomer!  I tried the HP printer I bought from the Best Buy store and I didn't like its performance.  The Best Buy store states that you can return it within 30 days for a full refund if you don't like its performance.  I took the Best Buy store for their word and I returned the HP printer to the Best Buy store after 25 days of use.  The Best Buy store would not take the return without me signing a statement stating that I would not return anything I buy until after a 90-day period from the time I returned the HP Printer.  I should have told them to F off and accept my return without signing their statement.  The Best Buy store also wants a photo ID from everyone when they return something.  If the item is being charged back to your credit card then you should not have too give them any ID!  This amounts too invasion of privacy (Big Brother).  AMAZON IS THE BEST BUY!  AMAZON DOES NOT ASK FOR A PHOTO ID!<br />My opinion is that the Best Buy store is not the BEST BUY! I believe Amazon is the BEST BUY!<br />MY OPINION IS THAT Amazon does have the BEST BUY.  Amazon is not like the so-called Best Buy store.  It is my opinion that Amazon ALWAYS gives you the BEST BUY.  I will stay committed to Amazon and quit buying from the so-called Best Buy store.  Amazon has fantastic delivery, great service, in most states no tax, in most cases free"

For those that use many complex internet applications that require custom settings, that program offers more granular control for those willing to dig down into the settings.  The basics are all covered here, but it is not as easily reconfigured.  On the same token, the default setting of the program requires constant confirmation for the system to adjust security settings for your applications.  It is possible to limit these warnings, but the configuration is not set ideally out of the box.    CONCLUSION    The strengths of the program are the improved easy to use interface and faster anti-virus scanning.  This 2009 version will definitely use less system memory than prior versions, at least directly.  It seems easy to punish McAfee and Norton for their past sins, but both products have improved slightly in that regard.

1452509,2289098,"sample pack of thick 8.5-by-11-inch Canon Pixma Photo Plus Glossy II paper. Unpacking and setup were straightforward and only took about 10 minutes. Each ink cartridge snaps into its color-coded slot on the print head with a firm \\""click.\\"" A red light comes on to show that it's properly seated. After I installed the cartridges and put some cheap paper in the fold-up top feeder, I pressed the RESUME button on the front panel and, following a lot of whirring and clanking, a test page popped out. I didn't know quite what to make of it. It's just a bunch of blue and gray rectangular resolution targets, but I guess that's what it's supposed to be.<br /><br />SIMPLE WIRELESS SETUP--NOT!<br /><br />Software installation on my ancient Windows XP system was not nearly as straightforward. I'd just had problems connecting a [[ASIN:B00HM0IVDY Canon iX6820]] to my wireless network, so I figured I'd have to use a USB cable to get this one going. But I couldn't even get to that point in the setup program. About three steps into the process, it kept crashing with the dreaded message \\""MSETUP4.EXE has encountered a problem and needs to close. We are sorry for the inconvenience.\\"" I thought for a while that I had just acquired a new paperweight to adorn my office. Then I had a brainstorm. I downloaded the printer driver from the Canon website, thus bypassing the setup CD, and that worked fine. On to the next issue...<br /><br />I ran into the same wireless network connection shenanigans that I'd had with my iX6820. There was no way the iP8720 would connect to my network. But this time I knew what to do. I simply ran a USB cable from the printer to the computer. A few mouse clicks later, the printer showed up on my network. Ta-daaa! However, I don't think users should have to hard-wire the printer to their computer in order to set it up wirelessly. I recently set up both HP and Epson wireless all-in-ones, and neither one of them required hoop jumping nor a cable in order to hook them up to the network. Setting up this Canon is unnecessarily complex, in my opinion. If you'll be using it on a wireless network, you might as well just use a USB cable right off the bat and save yourself some time. I'm willing to believe the installation software issue is related to my old computer or operating system, but NOT the wireless setup problem. Apparently that's a common issue.<br /><br />FEATURES AND PRINT QUALITY<br /><br />So, with all that said, what about the features and print quality? Well, I haven't tested it at full 13-by-19-inch size yet. It'll be a while before I get around to that. I really don't want to waste paper that costs a couple of bucks per sheet--not to mention the ink it'll use--on a print that I really don't need just to test the printer. However, at letter size the output is exceptionally crisp and sharp. It's perhaps the best inkjet printout I've ever seen. Color matching is, of course, a hit-or-miss affair unless you go through a whole end-to-endsystem color calibration. I didn't, so I can't really say how well an iP8720 printout matches the colors on the screen. They look fine to my eyes, but everyone sees things differently, so you may not agree. Print speed is pretty fast considering the high-resolution capability.<br /><br />I didn't test it exhaustively with different paper sizes, weights, finishes or scene content, mainly because I'm not yet ready to go out and buy $50 or $75 worth of ink cartridges. I suspect there's very little ink in the \\""starter\\"" cartridges, so I'm saving them for printing things that I really need.<br /><br />All in all, the iP8720 is a fast, capable wireless color inkjet printer that produces superb prints, at least at the sizes I've tried and potentially up to 13-by-19 inches, with little fuss. Based on my limited testing"

The result sounds like her old On The 6 singles and it was meant to; Jennifer asked writer/producer Redone to come up with a track that was the evolution of her classic sound and the lead single was the result. Lyrically it's follows a basic 'get down and boogie' formula, but the r&b/pop/Latin/Lambada music screams summer, so this is a very appealing song. I didn't like it at first, but once you hear it it takes root in your head and you'll be humming it for months.       Good Hit     I view this as a filler; it's not bad and it's not something that I tend to skip, but there's nothing here that hooks me in.

And the two producers have their hearts in the right place.

I think I know what I like and what I don't like about the album.  I like any song where Carla is singing.  I would compare the quality of the female vocals to that of MBV, Lush, Ivy, Sonic Youth.  All huge compliments on the types of vocals I like hearing.  While I think Autolux has a unique musical quality--it is pretty obvious that someone listens to Sonic Youth because some of the noise and disjointed rythyms remind me more of SY than MBV.  Frankly, I want to hear more of Carla and the Lush-Ivy-MBV influence than some of the qualities of Sonic Youth (who I love--but cannot listen to over and over), simply because I think what Autolux has done on this album needs to be done again and again.  More Carla!  Why 4 stars?  5 stars is earned by the continuous play over and over again for over a week.  While I listen to the Here Comes Everybody (song 8) to Capital Kind of Strain (song 11) a couple of times a day... the entire album has not caught me yet.

She switches gears on the clever \\""Rich Hipster\\"", in which she references all things 'eclectic' and 'cultured.' She matches her tastes by bringing in standout Wale, who seems a nice fit given his gift of rhyming.

1477107,1801130,sample this morning before breakfast.  I often do a quick read through of a group of samples to decide which ones I want to add to my reading list and which ones to put aside.  The Invasion grabbed me right off the bat and I was lost.  The story was relentless. It moved along at rocket speed and just when I thought it could not get any more frightening or creepy - it did.  This was an easy read.  I liked that it wasn't filled with a lot of techno-babble.  There were just a few main characters and it was easy to keep up with the action.  I absolutely love stories which allow mankind to shine with the best virtues even under untenable circumstances.  I love triumphs of perseverance against alien devices and ingenuity.  The Invasion was an exciting and scary armchair adventure.<br /><br />I have read several review

1485695,807825,"sample sheets). Photo prints made on this printer are gorgeous, and the ink is dry when the printer spits out the paper. This printer is a really good reason to stop going to the department store to have photos printed out.<br /><br />I like the little status screen on the printer. It makes it a breeze to access menus, print from the SD card slot, and set up the printer. Frankly, I don't know how I got by with older inkjets that required a series of arcane button-presses to get what I wanted out of them.<br /><br />The scanning/copying are both excellent and fast. Color copying is true to the original (and of course, better if you use glossy paper), and black/greyscale are both quite impressive, rivaling my laser printer in terms of quality.<br /><br />Looking around the Internet, I found the ink and glossy paper for VERY reasonable prices. I think Kodak has the right idea here! Instead of selling the printer for dirt-cheap and gouging customers on the ink and paper, Kodak is selling the printer for a reasonable (but higher) price, and then selling us the supplies at a much more sane price point. Affordable upkeep on this printer seems to be the focus when it comes to their pricing scheme, and I agree with it wholeheartedly. Yes, you can pick up a Lexmark or HP for less money initially, but you *will* pay for it in the long run!<br /><br />The only thing missing on this printer is fax capabilities, but it's not like I send many faxes anyway. I can live without it, but if you're in business and need a fax machine as part of your all-in-one, you'd be better to move to Kodak's other models.<br /><br />As far as looks and style, the printer is slick-looking. It's relatively compact, and only needs one cord (AC power) coming out the back of it. The screen flips down, and everything seems kind of classy. I like that when you open the printer to change ink, there's a little prop (not unlike what you'd find under a car's hood) that keeps the printer open while you're doing your thing. I also like that the print head is separate and removable/replaceable. If the print quality ever goes downhill, you have an option to troubleshoot it.<br /><br />I have ONE complaint, and it's a small one: I'm kind of sick of every piece of computer electronics having a bright blue LED on it. In the Kodak printer's case, the large blue LED is the WiFi connection indicator, and it sometimes stays on-- glowing quite brightly-- even after you've finished printing. As I keep my printer in my bedroom, it's one more light distracting me at night. I find myself needing to cover the LEDs with electrical tape with this and other devices. I think a smaller, more subtle light would have been just fine.<br /><br />Bottom line: This printer is awesome. I'm a convert, and while I still like the laser for quick document printing, I now see a lot of use for color and I think I'll get a lot more out of my digital camera now that I can print quality photos at home quickly, easily, and inexpensively.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good inkjet printer/scanner/copier, go for the Kodak.<br /><br />UPDATE 02/11:  So I learned the hard way that even if you have a brand new, unused black cartridge in this printer, it WILL NOT PRINT Black/White documents if the color cartridge is empty or missing. It doesn't matter that you're not printing in color; It flat-out refuses to work at all if BOTH cartridges aren't present and have at least a little ink in them.<br /><br />I think this is a cruddy way to do business. If I am only printing in black, I shouldn't need to run out and get a color cartridge to make the printer function at all. I'm sitting here with a stack of documents to print out, and no way to do it with just a new black ink cartridge. Without replacing color, too, I'm unable to get anything done at all.<br /><br />Kodak: You can release a firmware update that eliminates this boorish behavior by the printer. There's no reason to force us to have color ink just to print a text document. FIX THIS.<br /><br />As a result of this bad business decision on Kodak's part, I have knocked one star off this review"

That compares pretty unfavorably with the other major marques like Sony and Sharp... but is borne out by what I've heard from sales people at electronic retail stores (ie, quasi-independent experts).

At the time of writing, the failure rate looked like it was hovering around 20%, which doesn't sound great - until you compare that to the failure rates of other humidifiers!<br /><br />Bottom line: if I need another humidifier, this is my benchmark and I'd definitely consider buying it again ... from a store with a great return policy.<br /><br />--UPDATE III: Comparison with SPT SU-4010--<br />I recently purchased the SPT SU-4010 from Amazon, which is another highly rated cold/warm mist humidifier.

This one feels like a standard razor, except it has the smooth-inducing lubricants. It slides so easily over the face and it gives you a shave just as good as you'd get from a top of the line standard razor made by any company -- except it faceguards your face. I suspect people who try it will stay with it. My former foster son just got out of surgery and has to watch that he doesn't cut himself or he can bleed to death due to his meds. He often would cut himself with his razors so I gave him those cheap Bics for sensitive skin, because if used properly they do the job and are cheap.

The graduated keyboard weighting on this keyboard, to my mind, is fantastic. I can essentially play the same number of varied weights of key strikes as on my grand. Theoretically, the grand should have many more possibilities for how a note sounds depending on how you hit the key. In practice, I don't know that I'll ever have the feel for more than a few different strikes. I can make that happen in as many different ways on the Yamaha as I can on my grand. In reality, I play normal notes, somewhat softer notes, somewhat louder notes, and an occasional big bang if the music calls for it. So more than 4 weights is really more than a player like me needs. LOL This keyboard detects at least six different levels of strike that I can tell. A more skilled player might coax more than that out of it. It really is amazing.<br /><br />6. The manual does a good job of instructing the owner how to use the vast number of features available with this keyboard. The early part of the manual goes through each feature in broad strokes, and later on you get more step by step detail. This is perfect tiered instruction.<br /><br />7. The sound is nice, but of course its not going to be as big as I can get from the grand. I'm already brainstorming hooking it up to a receiver via the headphone port and playing it through some full sized speakers. ;-) NOTE: Once I thought of doing that, I couldn't stand waiting to do it. I have an old JVC receiver that has been gathering dust since I replaced it with my first 5.1 surround receiver, and also a couple of old 30\\"" speakers that I haven't used in a really long time. Luckily I had a mini RCA to stereo RCA cable, and a mini RCA to headphone jack adapter. After a few minutes of gathering up receiver, speaker, cables, and finding the adapter in a drawer where it had been hiding for 15 years, I had all this hooked up to the keyboard. It sounds fantastic. I get reverb that sounds VERY close to that of my grand. The bass tones of the Yamaha are much more rich coming through the receiver and the larger speaker. I haven't even hooked up a second speaker yet. LOL The volume potential compared to the small speakers on the keyboard is tremendously higher. There is no way I could crank it to full volume and stay sane. If you don't have some old equipment laying around like I did, and are eager for the better sound, even a bargain basement receiver and cheap floor standing speaker will still make this keyboard sound very much like a real piano (or organ, or any of the other voices).<br /><br />A couple of things I didn't like right off the bat:<br />1. The rhythm accompaniments seem overpowering. It may be that I can adjust the volume for those separately, and just haven't figured out how to do that yet. If I do I'll come back and update this note.<br />2. Although there are hundreds of voices, a lot of them are a bit tinny sounding. That might improve if I get my full sized speaker set up going, however.<br />3. The sample music on the keyboard is all a bit gimmicky sounding. They were keen to show off all the things the keyboard can do to accompany you, but I would have appreciated a good song playing just the regular grand piano voice without all the add-on sound.<br /><br />My cons are pretty picky though. They are nothing that really gets in the way of playing and enjoying this instrument. The price on keyboards with these advanced features have come down dramatically over the last three or four years. Not too long ago you'd have had to pay more than two \\""grand\\"" for a full keyboard with graduated key weighting and the other features found on this one. I got this on sale for six hundred. Like I said, it will pay for itself in just a few tunings I won't have to pay for on the grand.<br /><br />If you're a professional musician, I don't know if this keyboard has what you need or not, but if you are, you are unlikely to need this review"

1512946,131657,"sample of Blu-ray Discs (mostly nature documentaries and concert titles) so it's not too likely you'll notice this shortcoming on most program material.  Where the player actually does very well is in noise reduction - it can clean up less-than-stellar Blu-ray and DVD masters without making them look overly processed or removing too much authentic film grain from the image.  If you decide you'd prefer to bypass the player's on-board video processing, then simply switch over to \\""Source Direct\\"" mode which will output DVDs at 480i, and Blu-ray Discs at 1080i or 1080p, allowing an outboard video processor, or the display itself, to do the upconversion and de-interlacing.<br /><br />In addition to its standard HDMI output (with support for bitstream and PCM), the player also features a set of multi-channel (up to 7.1) analog outputs.  These will come in handy if you want to use the player with an older A/V receiver or preamp/processor that lacks HDMI audio decoding.  Like most players, the DBP-2010CI allows adjustment of number of channels, gain of each channel, size of each speaker (for bass management) and delay times for each channel.  Also, like most players, the subwoofer level can only be decreased (not increased) so you'll want to make sure your receiver has an option to boost the subwoofer level input (10 to 15 dB) if you intend to use the multi-channel analog outputs.  We tested these outputs with a number of music-oriented and action-packed Blu-ray titles (\\""Drum Line,\\"" \\""Hellboy II,\\"" \\""Dave Matthews/Tim Reynolds at Radio City\\"") and found that the player offered excellent dynamics and a smooth, balanced sonic presentation.<br /><br />The player is BD-ROM Profile 2.0-compliant which means it can do BonusView (PiP commentary) and BD-Live Network access, but it has no on-board storage so you'll need to insert an SD card of at least 1 GB in order for BD-Live to work.  It also lacks built-in WiFi support so you'll either need a hard-wired network connection or an aftermarket wireless bridge or wireless gaming adapter.  Also, as a \\""Custom Install\\"" product, the rear panel features a standard RS-232C output for integration with an automated home theater system such as a Crestron.<br /><br />The DBP-2010CI isn't for the casual Blu-ray consumer.  The long wait times and lack of internet streaming as well as the relatively high price tag may put these people off.  But those who appreciate a finely built and elegant performance piece will value what the DBP-2010CI has to offer.<br /><br />Our complete review"

And note that the application of any cleaner makes the front of the appliance appear or actually be darker. Still, we will be buying the wipes and even after the two grandkids come to visit, we'll be able to simply wipe off whatever smudges they leave behind. (Our 2.5 year old grandson was born with 12 hands, so we're also looking for a good glass cleaner. P.S. A house cannot be kidproofed against a 2 year old little boy.)<br /><br />Last, I'll be calling Bosch for an explanation as to whether this is stainless steel or clean steel (google, don't wiki this). A magnet will stick to the doors and that means clean steel. Clean steel will rust if scratched through, and I shouldn't be paying $2,400 for clean steel! IF manufacturers are using the terms interchangeably, then the practice should be stopped. And since our salesman knew the difference. but conveniently couldn't find his magnet, he should be stopped as well. We were assured that this was stainless.<br /><br />Would we buy this again? Probably. Our favorite brand became LG, but there are people who hate LG. Others hate GE, and other love KitchenAide. We can't buy one of each and see who's wrong. Sometimes I think that review"

Then, inspired by the contentment of a full belly and basically generous nature, calls his friends to partake of the alley feast, as well.<br /><br />Like a cat, he is seemingly blessed with a multitude of lives and a demeanor that dares you to contradict his \\""I am the King\\"" attitude. Always in trouble, Dev's unique code of honor keeps him trudging through his investigation. He doesn't give up. When he falters, he gathers the tattered shreds of his dignity and keeps plodding on.  He is a funny guy, always in trouble, rarely sensible.

1539039,490465,"sample of Los Kjarkas song Llorando Se Fue, which is popularly known for being used in the Kaoma single Lambada]<br /><br />Since Jennifer's last collaboration with Pitbull went so well [Fresh Out The Oven] it was only natural that she would team up with him again. The result sounds like her old On The 6 singles and it was meant to; Jennifer asked writer/producer Redone to come up with a track that was the evolution of her classic sound and the lead single was the result. Lyrically it's follows a basic 'get down and boogie' formula, but the r&b/pop/Latin/Lambada music screams summer, so this is a very appealing song. I didn't like it at first, but once you hear it it takes root in your head and you'll be humming it for months.<br /><br />Good Hit<br /><br />I view this as a filler; it's not bad and it's not something that I tend to skip, but there's nothing here that hooks me in.<br /><br />It's a empty pop/r&b driven song, with uninspired lyrics about how hot she is, so don't you wish that she was yours?

My boys have been fans of many of the Leapfrog products including the Tag Readers and most recently the Leapster Explorer, but this new device takes the cake. Here are some of my favorite features:    - compatible with Leapster Explorer game! I know this has been a point of contention for some Leapfrog buyers in the past. They buy the device and the games and then Leapfrog comes out with a whole new system. But with the LeapPad, you can use the same game cartridge you bought for the Leapster as well as the ability to put downloaded games onto either device.    - different users, different level. Both my 5 and 3.5 YO are fans of the LeapPad and with their separate log-ins, games, stories and activities are adjusted to their individual levels.     - learning, fun, entertainment and creativity all wrapped up into one. With a wide variety of apps, games and stories, the LeapPad offers your child a variety of activities to keep them engaged and ensure that they won't get bored with the device.    - Headphone jack! So thankful for this on long car rides.     - the 5\\"" touchscreen screen really provides a clear picture and seems pretty durable. (Though I am considering getting a screen protector for it.

It truly is an all-in-one handheld.    Leapfrog advertises that the batteries last about 8 hrs, but that might be a bit generous (or maybe time just flies).

The Mehr Saffron is only using the threads (stigma) and nothing else. There wern't any odd pieces floating around at the bottom of any of the jars I examined. Naturally it doesn't look like there's much in any of the bottles, but this is one spice you don't need much of.<br /><br />There are many recipes for saffron, but I wanted it for my rice. The rule of thumb is that you steep the saffron for fifteen or twenty minutes in a hot liquid before adding it to your dish. I added it to the water in my small rice maker early in the process. I swirled it around and quickly got that yellow tinge permeated the rice and the water that I expected. Needless to say, my saffron rice was perfect. Mind you a mere gram will usually be enough spice for 32 servings.<br /><br />This particular bottle is 1 1/2\\"" x 2\\"". It's small, but there are three full grams of top quality saffron inside. Yes, it's an expensive spice, but I did shop around and found that this saffron, in comparison, is fairly priced below what I've found. Historically there are all kinds of uses, but for my purposes I'm using it as a spice. I was very pleased with the result and would recommend it highly.<br /><br />Sample provided for review"

1555306,2721381,"sample it first. The Requiem from Tennstedt is even more of a specialised taste - good heavens is it ever slow! He takes more than a quarter of an hour longer over it than Previn does in my own favourite account, from 2000 with the LSO, taking it on to the second disc for Selig sind die Toten, which takes nearly a quarter of an hour by itself. And Previn's speeds are very average, slower overall than Klemperer's for one. I couldn't help recalling what Shaw said about Brahms's Requiem being tolerable only to the corpse. That said, Tennstedt knows what he is doing, his account has full consistency of approach, and the sepulchral (though quite distinct) quality of the recording is all part of the effect, still exercising that hypnotic quality that Brahms commands. I was a little disappointed by Wie lieblich, where Previn's dry-eyed approach, although again part and parcel of his view, left me hankering for a slower beat, but somehow Tennstedt misses the magic. What complicates the issue is the soprano solo from Jessye Norman. It's slow again, but when that great laser-beam of a voice pealed out with Ihr habt nun Traurigkeit I don't mind who knows that tears were rolling down my face. Contrast may have something to do with it, but this is the greatest account of that great aria that I have ever heard.<br /><br />The Liebeslieder waltzes are from 1959, and the sound has been very well updated, although you may need to dampen the volume. The soloists are straight from performances of The Messiah conducted by Sargent in the Albert Hall with the `Oodersfield Choral Society, and the pianists are none other than Vronsky and Babin, names I had thought as mythical as Hansel and Gretel or as saints Cosmas and Damian.

They realize Canon cannot fill that fine art market and have actively engaged those companies. Not only promoting them with the presentation prints but also supplying the critical ICC profiles for so many different papers.<br /><br />The other reason to visit a camera store, if they are an authorized Canon store, they have likely gone through Canon's training program for these printers. I spent about two hours in the store after setting up this printer. After talking this over it was clear the Pro-10 was exactly the right printer for my needs, I happened to get the right one by sheer luck. I spent a long time sorting through paper, there are hundreds of options. Photographic paper never had this much variety and high quality paper. I could have never chosen the paper I did from descriptions, I had to see sample prints and touch that paper to make my decisions.<br /><br />The maximum print size is 13 x 19 inches (maximum width is 13 inches - the length can be longer but I was warned that a lot longer like 30 inches is not a great idea). For gallery and sale, I find that size is perfect. Once a print is framed with the appropriate matte, this is an ideal print size. My photographs end up behind museum glass and are framed professionally, an off the shelf 16 x 20 from Target isn't the final resting place for my prints. I think Canon did exactly the right thing with this particular size limit.<br /><br />The printer is worth 5 Canon Professional Services Points. Although not available in the loaner program, they do offer trans shipping of a replacement during repairs.<br /><br />The choice between the Pro-10 and Pro-1 is a tough one.

He's also pretty bad about turning them off when he's done playing with them, so we go through a lot of batteries here, too.  While I didn't put a stopwatch on the length of time each type of battery lasted, and because of the aforementioned problem with my little boy turning them off when done, I couldn't easily do a straight-up comparison on how long each type ran a train.  But, as expected, the Sanyo battery lasted a great deal longer before needing to be recharged. (I could have perhaps put both trains on a track and just let them run until they stopped, but my wife was already giving me funny looks after I checked how many pictures I could take with the cameras!  :-)  )<br /><br />The main problem we had with our other rechargables was that they would stop holding a charge after a few months of relatively light useage.

According the Bursting with Nature, Shea butter &#34;promotes elasticity and protects your skin from environmental factors such as sun, wind and cold. Shea butter soothes and softens rough dry skin and conditions dry damaged hair. It soothes & alleviates diaper/skin rash problems and softens cracked heals and elbows. Shea prevents & fade away stretch marks and many people report success when they have been using raw unrefined Shea butter as their natural Eczema and Psoriasis Treatments. It also creates luster and shine on dull looking hair.&#34;<br /><br />I've used lotions with some Shea butter in them and loved them, but have never tried it raw and unrefined.

1572467,3408743,"sample recordings from my Dish DVR. The video quality on BEST was good viewed on a large screen, and BETTER looked good on the iPod Touch or iPhone. Even GOOD should be acceptable on the even smaller iPod Video screen as well. The audio is a different story, being full of video interference noise and ending up completely out of sync with the video. Not good at all.<br /><br />Overall, I was disappointed with this device; and there are a couple of things I would have liked to see changed or added on this unit. First, for something that should be so simple, I found it to have a lot of complicated little gotcha points when trying to set it up. Secondly, direct video to an iPhone or iPod Touch would have been welcomed, but maybe that is an Apple problem really. Thirdly, support for file systems other than FAT would also have been appreciated. I think Mac users are an after thought with this device, since they rarely have FAT formatted USB drives sitting around. Next, at around $100, they should at least include a USB cable and maybe even an S-Video cable. Even cheap $15 USB drive enclosures include the USB cable! Lastly, you should be able to use the unused USB connector to attach this device directly to a computer, and then transfer the recording files directly onto the hard disk of your computer. This would be especially great for iPhone and iPod Touch users, as now you have to record to a USB device, then transfer the drive to a computer to move them to an iPhone..<br /><br />But the killer for me was that all was not even close to perfect with the encoded video files, and I tried all three settings, and both S-Video and Analog video inputs to try and make them work. Most of the audio tracks had buzzing and other noise that appeared to be video interference with the audio, but did not occur in the source material. And almost all encodes had completely screwed up the audio and video sync, making it look like I was watching a badly dubbed foreign film. S-Video was always off, and by half a second or more, and on regular video, it started OK and then stuttered and went bad a few seconds in. And sadly, the sync problem got worse on better settings. I recorded to several different USB hard drives as well, just to be sure it was not a drive speed error, and the results were the same on all drives tested. If it were a drive issue, after trying 5, I would say that many people would have issues too.<br /><br />Here is a sample of a recorded video straight out of the unit. (This file is 2.2 MB in size) recorded at Best setting via S-Video input. You will see the video quality is very good, but note the audio and audio sync issues with even this small recording.<br /><br />Full version in .mov format here<br />MyMac rating: 2 out of 5. It kills me to rate this so low, as I really wanted this device to work well. It does record video files, but for a Mac , iPhone or iPod Touch user, it is a pain in the butt given the file type limitation. It was not as simple as it should be with a lot of complication in basic specifications to understand. But the true killer is the badly recorded video files with noise and sync issues. This drops this down a full 2.5 points in my view. It may be great for recording video game play where audio sync may not be so critical, but for TV and movies, this device needs a serious update, if that is even possible.<br /><br />Update: After my first submission of this article and the problems I had, I was contacted by someone at Pinnacle. Seems there was a firmware update for this unit that I was not aware of. I did not even know you COULD update this unit, but it does say so in the back of the small manual that came with it (but who reads those?) I also did a Google search, but unless you use the word \\""update\\"" along with \\""Video Transfer Pinnacle\\"", it could rather difficult to find this update.I guess one should always look for updates and read ALL of the manual. I am so spoiled by programs that update themselves, that I simply did not think to look further for something I never expected to exist. Basically, Pinnacle has the ability to update the firmware on the unit. You copy the new \\""bin\\"" files to a clean, newly FAT-32 formatted memory stick, connect it to the unit and turn it on. The update took only a few seconds and happens automatically.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise when recordings made with the update no longer exhibit the audio sync issue OR the noise I originally saw. This is now recoding exceptionally well, sync issues are gone, as it the audio noise. I was told that only a few units had this issue, and lucky for me, I received one of them. (You would think that companies would actually check units sent to review"

They were both freshly opened at room temperature (as we would store a jar of mayo in a pantry). Before actually tasting them I took a photo of the samples side-by-side under the same lighting. Note that the Hellman’s mayo is very slightly more yellow in color. This is apparent when looking at the product inside the jar as well.<br /><br />Here are the taste results: combining the results of 3 tests, the Hellman’s was VERY slightly more tangy, which I identified as a little more of a lemon taste. They do not taste the same! It’s not an earth-shaking difference, mind you, but the difference is enough to notice. Neither tasted “better” (and I realize most people don’t eat their mayo from the tip of a spoon). But the taste is not identical. Now, you are probably dying to know how they both compared to Kraft Mayo (which is the brand I reluctantly use these days). Okay, I have never “loved” Kraft Mayo. I buy it because it’s cheaper and for the reason discussed below. Compared to both Best Foods and Hellman’s the Kraft Mayo tastes a little more of eggs, but it also tastes a little more of a very slight chemical flavor. I can only describe it as not tasting as “pure”. It is my least favorite of the three.r />To prepare for the taste test I bought a jar of Best Foods mayo at my local store. I approached the taste test as seriously as any food or beverage tester would approach any test and the results are as fair as I could possibly make them in my home kitchen.<br /><br />For the purpose of this review"

Naturally it doesn't look like there's much in any of the bottles, but this is one spice you don't need much of.<br /><br />There are many recipes for saffron, but I wanted it for my rice. The rule of thumb is that you steep the saffron for fifteen or twenty minutes in a hot liquid before adding it to your dish.  I added it to the water in my small rice maker early in the process.  I swirled it around and quickly got that yellow tinge permeated the rice and the water that I expected.  Needless to say, my saffron rice was perfect.

The espresso the Pixie makes far exceeds what the Keurig can brew and rivals any espresso I've had at the various coffee shops here.  Although the cup of espresso the Pixie brews is smaller in volume than a regular cup of coffee, I quickly got used to that.  I actually found myself taking more time savoring the espresso instead of just gulping it down.  Having coffee in the morning is a much more pleasant experience now.<br /><br />The features of the Pixie that I found a real plus:<br /><br />* The footprint is small which leaves more countertop space.<br /><br />* The machine is ready to brew in 30 seconds and brews a cup of espresso in 25-30 seconds.<br /><br />* The power cord length is adjustable.  Extra cord can be stored in the base.<br /><br />* There is a carrying handle that doubles as the lever for the chamber where the coffee capsules get inserted.  When lifting the Pixie by the handle, the machine is nicely balanced making it easy to carry.<br /><br />* The functions are simple; On/Off button, Regular cup brew button, Larger cup brew button.  Both of the brewing buttons are backlit.<br /><br />* The machine powers off automatically when not in use.<br /><br />* The compartment for spent capsules (which is clear) is backlit by an LED light.  Not only does it look very stylish, it also helps to see when you're brewing a cup of espresso in a dimly lit area.<br /><br />* A red light on the back of the machine lets you know when the water level is low.<br /><br />* The espresso capsules are aluminum and recyclable.<br /><br />* The machine is very easy to clean.<br /><br />This package also includes the Aeroccino Plus milk frother.

The frother is also built sturdily and very easy to clean.  I often find myself making a quick cup of cappuccino after dinner with a shot of kahlua, something that I never really did at home before.<br /><br />At approximately 60 cents,  the cost of the Pixie capsules can be a bit steep but I'd spend much more than that for an espresso at Starbucks, and Keurig cups cost about the same.  You can get Nespresso capsules at various retailers but it's cheapest if you order them directly from Nespresso online.  Some of the review"

You may also want to keep a kit around for burns, bruises, stings and scrapes.<br /><br />Lavender Mint Toothpaste - A tingly vegetable and chalk based toothpaste with ingredients like the oil of peppermint, spearmint and clove. Cranberry extract purifies and refreshes the gums while the bentonite clay scrubs and polishes your teeth. Worth trying if you are allergic to regular toothpaste. The addition of geranium oil and lavender was a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />Res-Q Ointment - One of my favorite soothing remedies with a slightly medical scent. You can use this on bumps, bruises, burns, stings and scrapes. It is made with sweet almond oil, olive oil, beeswax, cocoa butter, wheat germ oil, vitamin e, lavender oil and comfrey extracts. Lavender heals the skin faster and vitamin E helps to prevent scars.<br /><br />Lifeguard's Choice Weatherproofing Lip Balm - Perfect for outdoor sports in the summer or winter. Made with beeswax, coconut oil, sunflower oil, vitamin E and delicious things like peppermint oil. Also contains comfrey root extract and rosemary extract.<br /><br />Hand Salve - This product produces feelings of elation for some reason. I think it must be the flower extracts. Ingredients: Sweet almond oil, olive oil, beeswax, vitamin E, comfrey extract, rosemary oil, lavadin oil, flower extract, eucalyptus oil. This is a greasy product that will seal in moisture and you can apply it at bedtime or before gardening.<br /><br />Rosemary Mint Shampoo Bar - I've used this as a soap because of the oat protein that seems soothing to my skin. I also like the scent of the rosemary in the shower.<br /><br />Feeling Flaky Shampoo - A total scalp and hair cleanser that is perfect to use every few weeks to wash away residue from other products. Makes your hair and scalp feel super clean and nourished. Especially good for a dry scalp in the winter.<br /><br />And now for the highly scented product...<br /><br />Poison Ivy Soap - A strong smelling soap, so best to keep this in a plastic soap container you would use for travel.

1607129,1930800,"freebie Kindle book.  Normally, I am not a fan of ghost-story PNR romances but I really like this author's work and was curious to see what she would do with a ghost story.<br /><br />The story centers on two brothers who were on the opposite sides of the English civil war.  Vernon Heatherington was the royalist, Earl of Rustead.  His younger brother Nathaniel was a Roundhead.  In the 1600s the brothers dueled, a circumstance that lead to both of their deaths.<br /><br />But they did not just die.  Instead they, and another ghost known only as the Monk, are forced to haunt Rustead abbey for centuries for reasons unknown.  So they watch year and after year, as times, fashions, politics, inventions come and go.  And they get to witness their own descendants as they live, grow and die in the Abbey. They are only allowed corporeal form once a year on the day they died.  For Vernon that is Halloween.  For Nathaniel that is Christmas. Obviously they are waiting for something...some sign...or some break that will tell them why they are unable to move on.<br /><br />For Vernon his break comes in the 1800s when he falls hopelessly in love with Cassandra, Countess of Rustead and wife of the profligate eighth Earl.  Nathaniel's break doesn't come for another 200 years when in 2012 he falls in love with the Sylvie the American countess and wife of the 12th Earl.<br /><br />In essence this was two romance novellas in one larger volume with a connecting hook.  Each romance pretty much followed the same trajectory with the ghost falling in love with the unhappy countess and given the opportunity to become visible to her for awhile and right a terrible wrong about to happen to her.  Each man's 'get out of jail free"

It's true that they are all manner of sizes and therefore present certain stacking challenges, but if they aren't the type that are open topped (with the lid inevitably lost), they are magic.

1633328,521252,"sample in a Cincinnati grocery store.  Although the one I tried was the \\""zesty\\"" version.  I actually prefer the zesty version, but when they were out and this was all that was left, I decided to give it a try.  And it is still really good.<br /><br />This is a traditional Greek vinaigrette with lots of herbs, a touch of cheese and a vinegary twang to it.  The cheese actually tasted more like feta to me than the Parmesan it is, but that could be because that's what I associate with it in my head.  It's pretty strong, so those that like a lighter flavor to their dressings might not enjoy it, but I like that big kick of flavor.  And a tablespoon or so is enough to cover a decent sized portion of salad so the bottle lasts forever.<br /><br />The ingredients aren't bad.  There's the oils, vinegar, the cheese and all the spices, along with some xanthan gum that they says prevents separation.  Nothing is organic of course, but it still has a minimal ingredient list, which sometimes is just as good.  A serving size is 2 TB which contain 150 calories with a large amount of fat (16g) and 10mg of sodium.  So it probably could be a little better in terms of nutrition.<br /><br />I enjoy this dressing and even more so the other kind from Matsos.  I'm definitely going to continue buying them.  And even better, for those in Ohio, it is a local product (but don't let that stop you if you're front out of state!).<br /><br />Review"

It had a superb supporting performance from Saeed Jaffrey, along with a rare but pivotal appearance by Michael Caine's wife, Shakira. This was a film that director John Huston had planned for years, and was nominated for four Academy Awards. The film is very true to Kipling's story, but goes into less Masonic detail.<br /><br />One of the more interesting aspects of this tale is that it was loosely based on historical fact, of which Kipling was aware. Josiah Harlan, a Pennsylvania Quaker, journeyed to Afghanistan in the 1820s, and through a series of wheeling and dealing, was crowned the Prince of Ghor (a province in central Afghanistan). Ben Macintyre's book [[ASIN:B00699S9NQ The Man Who Would Be King: The First American in Afghanistan]] details his story, including Free"

But Bynx waded in there and lapped/crunched his way through about ten of the pale objects, just to keep the female from getting any. A little later, he was lying on his cat mat by the window looking discontent in a unique way to the other hundred expressions of discontent he can muster. He was grouchy all day. I put out about 5 of the nuggets for the female, and she only ate 2 and left the other three. Then she drank a bunch of water, and seemed to go over and loom over the male, as though laughing at him for being so stupid. (Anthropomorphizing? Maybe. I pay very close attention to my kitties when trying new food on them.)<br />To be fair, in the product review"

Directly out-of-the-box, with absolutely no training whatsoever, Dragon 11 immediately proved that it was capable of recognizing approximately 95% plus of my speech patterns.  Because the nature of my business requires that I use many technical terms that are not included in the Dragon dictionary, several of the words I continually use were not recognized.  Nonetheless, after expending a few simple seconds to train Dragon to accurately recognize those words, the issues were entirely resolved.    Now, I feel I may comfortably state that Dragon has approached a near 100% rate of accuracy.  I will also add that I am using nothing other than the headphones that were included with my purchase of Dragon NaturallySpeaking 11. Although several users have commented that the headphones appear to be cheap, I'm quite happy with them.    In closing... I can only say that I am entirely satisfied with my purchase of the new version of Dragon NaturallySpeaking 11.  This entire review"

The same is true of the streaming stuff:  sometimes it's DVD-quality, sometimes it sounds as good as a Blu-Ray.<br /><br />CONTROLS<br />The remote is long and skinny, and covered in buttons.  Like most remotes, you probably won't use the majority of the buttons very often, but a nice thing is that there are four input buttons that you can map to anything.  In other words, if I press the Blu-Ray button, it automatically switches inputs and sound for me.  These four buttons are also on the front of the unit, so if you're first powering things on and standing in front of your system, no remote is necessary at all:  just tap the button and have a seat.  Many of the typical playback buttons on the remote work in any context:  in other words, play/pause and next/previous will perform the same tasks when listening to an MP3 that they do when watching a video.<br /><br />As if that isn't enough, there is a remote control app for your Android or iPhone that is available for free"

I hope that others who have loved ones (including aging parents) will consider this camera as a possible live connection to check in with them. It is truly awesome.<br /><br />I was very surprised at how easy this was to set up.

Nothing sticks and you never have to worry about how you are going to extract the waffles from the baker. They slide out, no problem. While the waffle baker can't be taken apart for cleaning, it was easy to wipe the baker clean once it had cooled completely. Here is my secret Seasoned with Love recipe for delicious Buttermilk Waffles:<br /><br />Buttermilk Waffles<br /><br />These waffles are decadent when served with boysenberry syrup, strawberries, whipped cream and confectioners' sugar. I prefer using all-purpose flour from King Arthur Flour. Sometimes I make my own applesauce and serve these hot with warmed applesauce and a drizzling of maple syrup and fresh cream.<br /><br />2 large egg whites<br />2 large egg yolks<br />1/4 cup granulated sugar<br />3 cups low-fat buttermilk<br />1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted<br />2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br />1 teaspoon extra dry white vermouth<br />3 cups unbleached all-purpose flour<br />1 teaspoon baking powder<br />1 teaspoon salt<br />1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br />Corn or canola oil<br /><br />Set a Belgium waffle baker on to heat. In a deep medium bowl, beat the egg whites to stiff peaks. Whites will have tips that stand when the beaters are lifted. In a large bowl, beat the yolks and sugar. Then, add the buttermilk, butter, vanilla and vermouth.<br /><br />Sift in the flour, baking powder, salt and soda. Beat for 1 minute, then gently fold in the egg whites. If desired, use a pastry brush to apply a thin coat of oil onto the inside of the heated waffle baker. Ladle a 1/2 cup of batter into the middle of each section and then spread batter evenly.<br /><br />Close the lid and bake for at least 6-8 minutes.<br /><br />Strawberries tossed with boysenberry syrup and cream makes a delicious topping. We also sprinkle them with confectioners' sugar.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"

In the instruction manual it also says to go to a specific internet address, and then \\""go to the Dashboard menu.\\""  Well there is no Dashboard menu from that page. If you go to Archerfish's main site, you cannot access the myportal page at all.  You can't sign into your account or navigate to the page you need to go to to setup and operate your cameras.  All you can do is view their products.  The ONLY way you will know which page to go to is that one page in the manual gives the correct address. I don't care that I can't view my images on the web, I have all the hardware in front of me, I should at LEAST be able to view local images from my computer without needing Internet access. Since everything is done over the web, if this company ever goes under or if there site is down, so is your camera.  This is way too much of a gamble given the price of this device.<br /><br />Another terrible feature- each camera requires a separate 12v power supply.  They can't all feed into the power supply for the main device.  This makes no sense.  All of the cameras have to hardwire into the power supply, and the cable that connects them even has two cables - one for video and one for 12v power. So why not run that cable, which is going to end right at the unit, into a power input on the back of the device.  That way they can feed off of the power supply that the base unit is using. But instead, you have to have a separate power supply, meaning that if you connect 4 cameras to this device, you are going to have 5 of those huge AC adapters that all need to be connected to the same power outlet.  Prepare to invest in a power strip solely for running this bulky device.<br /><br />The only pros are that it does come with very long video feed cables (although if you need more than 100 feet, you are out of luck because there is NO option for extending it due to the unusual design of the cables).  The cameras are also small and fairly stylish (about the size of a roll of pennies).<br /><br />I had this product for three years and despite desperately needing a home monitoring solution, these cameras mostly sat unused during the entire time I've had them.

It did get quite warm but not to kick into overheat mode. In a couple places I have to turn it back to 3 so it didn't sting so much. The only thing I notice at this early stage is a bit of itching or irritation in spots. I'll see what happens in the next month...<br /><br />Original: I tried my first small session today and my impression is that it's plenty powerful enough and the unit build quality looks great. I wound up using level 4 and 5 with my pale skin and brown hair. Mostly it felt like a pinch with heat flash but a couple spots felt more like a shock and probably because of more hair follicles. They say that the higher the level you can stand the better it takes the hair out. Of course I'm judging the correct level by how each flash should typically feel as well as noticing if the skin is not being adversely harmed. After the session I don't feel any discomfort or notice any redness or injury at all on the treated areas.<br /><br />I've read some of the low star review

Orlanko is a man who likes everything to be in their place and to need Andreas to clean up messed that couldn't be dealt with in the normal ways rankled him.<br /><br />But hey you know what they say about necessary evils and all that...<br /><br />Alex meanwhile is the protege of Metzing, a semi-retired master thief who hailed from Vordan and vowed never to return.

Except the job was a trap and the trap was for Metzing not Alex.<br /><br />The latter half of the short story is taken up with Alex learning the price of her talents.

We're never told where she gained her shadowy, inky tool and all the Black Priest claims is that it was lost hundreds of years ago due to a clerical error.<br /><br />Right. Sure.

1721701,2980202,"sample of Los Kjarkas song Llorando Se Fue, which is popularly known for being used in the Kaoma single Lambada]<br /><br />Since Jennifer's last collaboration with Pitbull went so well [Fresh Out The Oven] it was only natural that she would team up with him again. The result sounds like her old On The 6 singles and it was meant to; Jennifer asked writer/producer Redone to come up with a track that was the evolution of her classic sound and the lead single was the result. Lyrically it's follows a basic 'get down and boogie' formula, but the r&b/pop/Latin/Lambada music screams summer, so this is a very appealing song. I didn't like it at first, but once you hear it it takes root in your head and you'll be humming it for months.<br /><br />Good Hit<br /><br />I view this as a filler; it's not bad and it's not something that I tend to skip, but there's nothing here that hooks me in.<br /><br />It's a empty pop/r&b driven song, with uninspired lyrics about how hot she is, so don't you wish that she was yours? I've listened to it many times to review"

What I found online was that this is great in addition to normal flour in most baking recipes but not as a full substitute for normal flour.<br /><br />I did bake with this and it was wonderful, cookies came out just as nice using both coconut flour and normal flour as they would with just normal flour. The only trouble I had was the liquid content in baking recipes. The coconut flour seems to dry out some recipes and also is a bit more gritty and grainy than normal flours so you have to overcompensate with milk and water and sometimes eggs in your recipes.  Otherwise I found this to be a good addition to my baking ingredients. I will continue to try new things with it and see how they go.<br /><br />This review"

1724050,2869617,"freebie on her website, so based on this tale alone, I know I'll be stalking her website for more info.  Well, back to this book: Rafe is the baby brother of Dom from Logan's Need; the one who got abducted as a child and the reason his brothers formed their agency - so that they could find him. Except that little brother isn't as far away as they think, nor is he as innocent or as helpless than he was when he was taken; in fact, he's a hacker par excellence and he's been giving them trouble - not that they know his identity at this point.  Cade, Logan's bodyguard who'd been a standout character in that book, made me want his tale and I am so, so glad that he was the lead here. He's still the strong and sexy guy from that book, but here we see different sides to him. Initially, he's in charge of surveillance on Rafe (whilst the latter's identity is still unknown), but then Rafe becomes the object of his sexual interest, before Cade falls for him, and finally Cade has to become his protector.  The author wrote the leads very well, and especially so in Rafe's case. There is mention of past sexual abuse that has made him into the man he is today, but it's not graphic or prolonged, though Rafe is still suffering in the tale. She used that trauma to initially break him, then make him into the man he is today, the man who thinks he can count on no-one but himself, but the man who finds himself broken down and then fixed by his love for Cade.  At no point didthe author make me feel that the leads' relationship was unbalanced and that one was stronger than the other - I'm talking both sexually and otherwise. They had different strengths, but the same needs, the same feelings, the same loyalty and the same selfless love, and I believed in them and their love, fast-paced as the tale was.  For me, it had the perfect ending, one that I wouldn't have expected from a character as hardened as Rafe was initially, but a very welcome one. I confess to the tiniest disappointment that Logan and Dom aren't quite there themselves, though at the same time, I get why. Still, perhaps that'll be something we get to see in future tales in this series - after all, there's still Ren's tale to come.  I liked that Dom and Logan were in this a bit more than the other characters from previous tales, still as in love and needing each other as ever. It was also nice to hear about/see the past leads, especially with a couple of happy events taking place.  The only thing that took me away from the book a few times and caused me to lower the rating on it, is that the book could do with a touch of proofing, as there were a few errors that took me out of the tale and that a competent proofer - or even a beta - could have picked up on. Not enough to make me think it wasn't still a great read, but just niggly ones that gave me a few 'uwot??' moments.  Update 04/09/15 - I've just finished reading Vin and Mia's tale, which is a free"

1732170,261946,"sample...so your mileage may vary...<br /><br />If you buy these binocs, or any expensive binocs, first thing to confirm when you open the box, confirm the two sides are well collimated, if not, return them, as its very difficult to collimate binocs and they will provide you with years of headaches / light headiness, dizziness, etc.!  A simple test to determine collimation, focus on single subject at infinity... preferably something that fills the center of the image circle only (such as a street lamp many miles away)....then blink your eyes simultaneously, so you see right view / left view / right view, etc.....  If the binocs are not well collimated, you will see the subject jumping between views, as the brain holds the previous image long enough (image persistence) to notice the difference in placement between the two eyes.  While perfect horizontal collimation is not required as the eyes can converge (move together in cross eyed mode) with no problems, the eyes have very little tolerance for divergence  (i.e. move apart, the opposite of cross-eyed, as only a lizard can do) AND our eyes have virtually NO tolerance for vertical divergence, (one eye up, the other eye down) which is what must occur if one side shows the subject higher / lower vs. the other other side.  Any of these collimation issues become very apparent when doing the blink test.  If any new binocs are out-of collimation on horizontal divergence OR Vertical divergence, they should be returned immediately, as this creates large amounts of visual and mental stress, making the viewing process very annoying, leading to headaches, light headiness, disorientation, etc.  (but the avg. person would never know why, they will think its their meds or a food additive, or MSG in the Chinese food they ate :-)<br /><br />  With lower priced binocs, it pays to go to a store and test this out, so you can pick the sweetest pair in inventory, although the store manager may kick you out  :-)  Yet if a small bit of convergence exist, meaning the two subjects overlap a bit (inward), this is not so bad, as it adds a slight depth sensation for infinity subjects and rarely if ever provides any visual stress... cause its natural to cross our eyes a small bit when viewing close subjects,  (assuming its not extreme convergence which would be very noticeable with the blink test)  Remember, mental stress caused by collimation issues are a function of \\""how long\\"" the optics are used, combined with, how poor the collimation is and your tolerance of this oddity which our brain is not conditioned to deal with.  If you use binocs for a long time, such as birders do, proper collimation is critical for long hours of viewing.<br /><br />11.  Matched fl's.  Canon seemed to pay a lot of attention to assuring the fl's of each optical train, for each eye, are matched in magnification... .this is another very high-end featurewhich is often not a concern in lower priced binocs, sometimes creating mis matched magnification in each eye, creating a condition called retinal rivalry, i.e. the brain is battling two different sized images, which creates mental stress.  Often these subtle differences creates eye strain as well.  If the problem is extreme, you can see this in the blink test....not likely noticeable in binocs of the 10x42's quality.  (at least not significant enough to detect with such a simple test)<br /><br />Achieving all these variables, add-up to great binocular vision.  Binocular vision is hard to simulate at magnification as a result of many of the issues I pointed out above.... the more variables that go wrong, the worst the experience will be.  Clearly these 10x42 binocs have very good QC.  Now keep in mind, I may have luckily received a good sample... unless I tested many of samples, I would not know for sure how good the QC is.  With Amazons liberal return policy, I felt safe gambling and testing"

My wife covered the beauty side of it, I covered the kitchen side of it. Here's what we found.<br /><br />As a cooking oil, this is a great product. When the house is warm enough to keep this a liquid, it has much the consistency of olive oil, but as fall came, this was more often found in the container as a hard butter or lard-like texture. It was easy to spoon out, however, and made a really fragrant and effective cooking oil. I cooked various vegetable and meats with it, and found it added a delightful depth to lime and cilantro coated shrimp. I wouldn't use it to make eggs or something like that, but it can substitute easily and tastily in just about any dish where a fragrant flavored oil (sesame, olive, walnut, etc.) would be used. It really brought a new dimension to a lot of dishes.<br /><br />As for the beauty aspect, my wife tried this on her hands, body, face and hair. It provided smooth, nice-smelling, easily absorbed moisture just about anywhere she tried it. (I tried it on my hands and thought it was a little greasy, but I'm picky that way.) She also tried it as a sort of conditioner for her hair, but that experiment didn't work well. She ended up washing it out. Although it proved just as effective and easy to use as any of her other lotions, it may not be the most competitively priced option.<br /><br />Overall, this is a cooking and beauty oil with a lot of different uses and dimensions.

1755045,2395916,"sample point.  Also I ran at night, and the display of the MOTOACTV was bright and easy to see.  Calorie burn data was still about 150 low compared to similar measurements on my Forerunner.  I expected this to be consistent with indoor and outdoor training.<br /><br />MOTOACTV Website:<br /><br />Once you have workouts complete on the device, you can then sync them to the MOTOACTV web site.  While the syncing process itself is a little slow, everything else is top notch.  I'm not sure why Motorola didn't give an option to sync via USB.  This is how the Forerunner works.  The web site detects the device and uploads the data at the click of a button.<br /><br />However that is the only advantage that the Forerunner has.  The MOTOACTV web site itself performs well, and you view graphs with an overlay of heart rate and pace.  I have completely replaced my paper running log with the use of this site.  For outdoor workouts it provides a Google map of your route (I suspect that transferring this data is what takes the majority of the time syncing).  If you mouse over the graph data it traverses the map to show you where on the route you were.  The site also has extensive features for planning, goal setting, and fitness management.  This can be quite useful as long as you are not depending on the calorie data.  One area that is good in concept is the fitness music feature.  The MOTOACTV tracks your performance during each song in an attempt to identify the songs that make you perform at your best.  However this data will be skewed by factors such as interval training, and having to stop at intersections during outdoor runs.  If you are running on a track or a trail this is not as much of an issue, but you should take the data with a grain of salt otherwise.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />There are other features that I have not covered (or used for that matter).  However I am focusing on running since that is my main activity.  The question you may have is whether or not this device is for you.  The answer is it depends.  If you are mostly going to be running outdoors and are not concerned about accurate calorie burn data, the MOTOACTV will allow you to consolidate your heart rate monitor and mp3 player.  For indoor training or users looking to accurately track calorie burn for fitness goals, I cannot recommend the MOTOACTV.  You would be better served with a basic heart rate monitor from Polar and a separate mp3 player.  Please feel free"

I didn't even have to do anything special to eject the drive; you can just pull it out when the printer is done writing to it.  It will also scan to email or to a network drive.  Tip: It wants a pretty specific FAT format and sector size, so if it doesn't work, format the drive using the printer.  It stays connected to WiFi without fault, and wakes up from sleep to service any request.  It even received and processed a printout from the other side of my house behind a running microwave, which my iPad can't do.  Okay, back to my ancient environment.  There is no OSX 10.4 software for this printer, but I still need to print from my older Mac mini.  I installed the printer in Print Preferences by simply providing the TCP/IP address, and telling it to use a generic PostScript driver.  Done.  BTW, if you don't know what address the printer was assigned, you can print the Network Configuration report under the Setup menu.  As I said above I later discovered a discontinued printer, the CLX-4195FW, had almost the same exact specs as the C1860FW, right down to its size and weight.  It was basically a C1860FW without NFC printing.  It had OSX 10.4 drivers on its support site, so I downloaded and installed those on my old Mac.  They worked perfectly.  On my iPad, I simply said 'print'.  It found the printer and printed, no special software or setup required.  My 10.6 Mac could use the 10.5 and above software provided on the CD.  I tried to additionally use the CLX-4195FW scanner software that waswritten for 10.4 on my old Mac.  It saw the scanner and said the scanner was ready to scan, but unfortunately I could not let me select it, probably due to the difference in model numbers.  I'll just have to scan from my 10.5 or above Mac, my iPad, or from the control panel to a USB drive or email.  No biggie.  This printer has a built in web server that can tell you a great deal about the printer.  Just type the printer's TCP/IP address into a browser.  If you log on using the admin user ID and password found in the manual, you can change many settings from there too.  That web interface works well from my old 10.4 Mac.  Tip:  One of the things I found VERY useful was printing a map of the menus.  You can do that from the front panel under Setup, Reports, Help List, and through the web interface.  Would you believe that menu map is 12 pages long???  That's a lot of options!  Don't worry, you don't need to use the touch panel unless there is something about the operation of the printer you want to change.  By default it prints without interaction, copies with the press of a physical start button, and scanning is done from almost anywhere with very few clicks.  I installed the mobile app on my iPad to give it access to scanning.  There are currently a lot of bad review"

1781199,2352502,"freebie but it was a mixed read for me. On the plus side there were some interesting things happening in Blood Moon. In particular, the scene that set up the whole story was quite touching. The heroine romance writer Genie - who just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time due to a bout of writer's block - witnesses a man being shot in the head, and rushes to his side to offer him consolation as he dies in her arms.  Little did she realize that her compassion was going to result in a tilt in her view of the world, and, in the aftermath, there are some other bits here and there that are intriguing as the fire of Genie's curiosity helps her overcome a fear of a situation that makes no sense from what she knows of the world.<br /><br />So the reasons for my mixed reaction? On the not so plus side, Blood Moon was slow paced and exceedingly talky - and not scintillating dialog talky, but massive amounts of description enlivened by short key moments and just a touch of action. Blood Moon was told mostly from Genie's point of view, but was later interspersed with sections from the point of view of her mysterious guest. The switch was clearly deliniated by a shift in font hers/normal, his/italics - this was a plus in that there were no question as to who was narrating, but I just really do not enjoy reading italicized passages - it's a personal quirk as I find that italics add a tension to what I am reading, and I don't believe that was really the intent here.<br /><br />Mild spoilers both plus and minus, which don't give too much away if you've read the back cover blurb.<br />*************okay, if you've read the cover blurb you know that the dead man, Dominic, turns up on Genie's doorstep. On the plus side, I thought that his amnesia and the discovery of just why he didn't stay dead was well done, we have a pretty good suspiscion of what he is but the clues are not initially clear cut and when he begins to recover his memories the pace of the story does pick up a bit.  And now for my big nit: this is a paranormal romance, so Genie and Dominic become intimate and I did not find in the least bit appealing the descriptions of her fondling his cold body or of the 'thrustiness' involving his icy length penetrating her heat. I'm sorry, but frigid body parts in love scenes give me the shivers and not in a good way. **********end spoiler********<br /><br />Other parts I found interesting: even though I didn't read the first book (I didn't realize that there was one even though I just happend to have nabbed it when it was free"

Unfortunately, we were unaware that they charge tax--no matter what state you live in.  So consider that when you are doing your research.<br /><br />And regarding the color \\""Creamy White\\""--I saw it called \\""60's White\\"" somewhere, too:  We decided on this color hoping it would match with pale yellow appliances, cabinet inserts and some retro white small appliances and kitchen gadgets.  It goes very nicely.  If you need \\""white-white\\"", this color will not do.  This is creamy, going into very pale yellow.  If you have 50's-60's-70's white appliances that have started to age to a creamy yellowish, then this is the color for you.  I think an espresso machine that's offered in many colors is a great idea:  Most other machines are big, black, bulky and fairly ugly.<br /><br />UPDATE May 23, 2012:  It's over one year later and we are still using exclamation points to describe our pleasure with this machine.  Every morning we still pat ourselves on the back for making the decision to buy this Nespresso.  The coffee \\""Variations\\"" and \\""Limited\\"" releases that Nespresso issues several times a year have all been well received by the espresso drinkers in our house.  And we're still enjoying the other sixteen \\""Grand Cru\\"" coffee blends that Nespresso regularly offers.<br /><br />This machine has a very small footprint and, originally, we were concerned that the machine might not perform well because of its smaller size.  But we have found that the size is optimal and the water container size is optimal.<br /><br />We also now appreciate the convenience of the fold-up platform.  When we first bought the machine, we didn't realize just how handy it would be to be able to fit taller glasses underneath the spout.  During the winter I really got into double shots of espresso topped off with coffee or chocolate liquor and milk, and the ability to fold up the \\""short\\"" platform was very convenient.  I was also able to indulge myself with this treat after dinner--because the three varieties of decaf are excellent, too!<br /><br />No regrets with this machine.

1800044,1137812,"sample of the game's artwork, I have to say I'm quite satisfied with the outcome. I still prefer Twilight Princess' realistic style, but Skyward Sword looks great. The characters look alive and they have a wide range of facial and emotional expressions.   The landscapes and stages are at least as detailed as in Twilight Princess. From a distance, the impressionistic styleworks really well. Sadly, unlike Twilight Princess, there's no Hyrule FIeld, which was always my favorite part. Also, the other landscapes don't quite have that epic feel and almost look like they could have come out of a kid's game. Make no mistake - they look good, but not quite epic.   SOUND  Because Skyward Sword has such a deep story, it's all the more disappointing that Skyward Sword doesn't have voice acting. The on-screen dialogue text worked for past Zelda games because the dialogue was short and often transactional in nature. However, there are cinematic cutscenes in Skyward Sword and the text dialogue just becomes a chore to read and really detracts from the story. Worst of all is when there's dialogue on the screen but the character's lips aren't movie.  The soundtrack is good, but not quite at the level of Twilight Princess or Ocarina of Time. Again, as with the rest of the game, it's more lighthearted. It's tough to really judge while playing the game, so I'll have to wait until the full soundtrack is available for download.  GAMEPLAY  This is where Skyward Sword really shines. While I don't think the swordplay is necessarily a revolution, it does add a new dimension to the game. You actually have to think about HOW you slash and hack. The Wii MotionPlus or its equivalent will definitely be standard for any future Zelda games.  OVERALL  Skyward Sword is really hard to rate because it both exceeds expectations and disappoints. The impressionistic art style didn't bother me nearly as much as I'd feared. On the other hand, the game just feels a whole lot less epic than Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time, and especially Twilight Princess. I'll write an updated review"

Some of the dub mixes that showed up on earlier singles I found tolerable, but in the context of the rest of the material on the single, as this is nearly 40 minutes of this sort of stuff that I don't listen to, I find it nearly unlistenable.  One on one, some of the tracks are certainly interesting, the Meat Beat Manifesto remix being the most listenable and I think with the best beats and arrangement.  Not really sure what to make of the Spacetime Continuum mix, they seem to have ditched the original song except and written something new sampling a line from the chorus once or twice.  The Orb remix is full of good ideas, but falls short of succeeding and drags on seemingly endlessly.  I found both the Plug and the NIN remixes to be irritating, quite frankly. <br /> <br />So maybe I'm not the best person to review"

1810533,3135401,"sample of the fusion power and at first I thought it was the best razor because of the first few close shaves it provided. I got over excited and bought a 8 pack refill for the fusion power thinking I would never use anything else. BAD DECISION!!!! My clear unirritated skin became red and irritated after continuing to use the fusion power. At first I thought maybe my skin is changing as I'm getter older so it's my skin's fault. I would get ingrown hairs and it was then embarrassing to go out. I lost all my self confidence and started staying more reserved. I tried various skin treatments to rid of the irritations and redness but nothing would work. The problem with the fusion was that the blades would only last about 3 shaves and then irritate the hell out of your face. ONE DAY I DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO TRY ANOTHER RAZOR.    I then bought the Schick Quattro Titanium and boy was it a much less irritating shave with more comfort and the same closeness as the fusion. It was much much better than the fusion because of the titanium coating and the blades last forever. They would stay sharp for months and wouldn't clog if a shave gel was used.(I know people complain that it clogs but with a light foaming shave gel like Anthony Logistics or Zirh it doesn't).    Now Hydro 5 vs. Fusion Proglide    Hydro 5 came out first and since the schick quattro titanium was my razor of choice I had to try the Hydro 5. At first I liked it, the gel strip felt gooey but washed off easy with warm water. The shave was not as close as I would have wanted. The hydro 5 missed a few parts on the neck area and the under nose area because of the huge cartridge. Still I kept on using it since it came with 2 refills anyway. The gel strip lasted longer than fusion but not as long as quattro titanium.    Fusion Proglide: I bought the sneak peek package just to try the razor before it came out and all I can say is AWFULLLLLL!!!!!!! This time I couldn't even get one good shave from this crap. Turns shaving into gliding my A$$!!!! It's very uncomfortable to use and does not glide at all.I will admit that it provides a very close shave but that irriates my face a lot. So the fusion proglide is the worst razor I've ever used so far. The cartridge lasts only like two shaves and the refills are more expensive than a full tank of gasoline(mind the exaggeration but you know what I mean).    Final verdict: Gillette just tweaks their razors a bit makes false claims and sells their refills for a lot of money to fool the consumers. They are nothing but marketing now. Up until the Mach 3 they were my razor brand but the fusion and fusion proglide are nothingbut scams. They look cool but I think they are face wreckers. Then again I have sensitive skin so I understand people with thicker beards and normal skin probably love Gillette razors but I have to address the sensitive skin shavers out there and Gillette razors should be avoided by them unless they want a irritated face.    The hydro 5 lost because of the huge razor head and strip making it less precise. Also the skin guards on the hydro irritate more than help. So Schick Quattro Titanium is the razor of choice for my sensitive skin. It will not clog with Zirh or Anthony Logistics shave gel and causes no irritation. The blade lasts long and refills are reasonable price, it has the single edging blade which is better than hydro 5 flip trimmer which just irritates. Sorry for long review"

The pages also have games and activities to play aside from just the story. In its function, it reminds of the Little Touch Leappad we got about six years ago. Like the Little Touch though, you need to buy the books separately to work with the TAG Reading System, so it can get pricey if you want several stories. It makes me wonder if local libraries offer them for check out.<br /><br />As for teaching my child to read, I do not see how a pen that says the word for my daughter will help her learn to read at this age, but I suppose it will help her to recognize what is a word and what is not.

Given the large quality difference, I would assume that the Philips model does not have a screen capable of the full 720x480 pixel resolution of the DVD format. If I had to guess, I would say that half that resolution might be about right.    Does the screen quality matter during actual viewing? After all, it's one thing to see it during a brief visit to the DVD's menu system, but the issue is only significant if it's noticeable during movie playback. Fortunately, it's not all that noticeable for casual viewing, especially if you are doing so while it is on your lapor strapped to the back of the seat in front of you.    I asked my kids to try out the games disc and the battery-operated controller, and they played with it for a little while, but the games are quite basic, and I don't think they would hold their interest very long compared to those available on an iPod Touch.

Upon first hearing this release, I thought the release was a crossfader smashing excursion into ripped samples and overdubs, but after seeing short clips of the group rip it up live with instrumentation (and a bit of sampling), I'm fully convinced (not that I would have been any less impressed had they done it the other way around). The album wastes no time getting rolling, as the opener of \\""Panther Dash\\"" busts out of the gate with a 70s TV theme-show drum rumpus as a harmonica and guitar team up for a good natured showdown.<br /><br />From there, the listener is hardly able to catch a breath as \\""Ladyflash\\"" again busts loose with weird vocals and flutes that almost sound like Bollywood (chants of \\""We're here to rock the microphone\\"" included) while \\""Junior Kickstart\\"" sounds like a hyper-saturated theme containing bits from every cool car-chase sequence or Warriors-style throwdown lead-in done in the past 20 years. It doesn't really matter that half the time you can't make out the lyrics and the other half they're simply chants to \\""rock\\"" or countdowns to bring that beat back because the group flys by the seats of their pants with such reckless abandon that it's hard not to get caught up by it all.<br /><br />So yes, the group might be fluffy, and while they call to mind all the references mentioned above and then some, they do it in a way that makes it all sound fresh and fun again. Hearing Thunder, Lightning, Strike for the first time will probably give you sorta the same feeling you had when you first heard When I Left You by The Avalanches. You know you've heard the parts before, but you've never quite heard them put together in a way that the group has done it, and for that they put a grin on your face and a little bit of shuffle in your step.

This is leather that didn't meet quality standards that is sliced and then coated with polyurethane. Over time PU leather doesn't get softer like full hide leather. The look doesn't change over time, it stays the same.<br /><br />The smell is really worth getting over because of the beautiful design. The finish on this looks like old beautiful well used leather. It is incredibly handsome. The interior is a soft fabric that coddles my iPad.<br /><br />If you are looking for a snug fit, handsome sleeve - this is wonderful.

The \\""version 9 LE\\"" comes with 11 sound processing effects that I can apply to the audio such as chorus, delay, reverb, wah-wah, and distortion. There is also a 'Vocal Eraser' plug-in which tries to remove the vocals from the mix to make a karaoke version of a song; this works with varying degrees of effectiveness. I can archive vinyl recordings and use its 'Vinyl Restoration' noise reduction and 'Audio Restoration' features to adjust the amount of clean-up of clicks and pops and unwanted hiss. Although this software does not offer true multi-track mixing, it does allow me to mix external audio tracks into a recording. And although this is not a video editing tool, I can edit audio files and then attach them to video files. I import the video file, and then edit the soundtrack by scrubbing, as if I had a jog/shuttle control, using the [J], [K], [L] keys on my keyboard to reverse, pause, or forward the playback.

The software sucks. IF you can actually get it to install on your computer (I fought for days to do so) its usefulness is dubious. If you're familiar with the FlipShare software, you'll know what I'm talking about. The software offers BASIC (and I mean really basic) editing features and you can probably get around without ever using it. My suggestion is to not even bother with this bloated monster and install a real editing package instead. If you're on a Mac, check out iMovie and on Windows you can use something like Sony Vegas or another editing program. On Linux, you can use OpenShot or Cinelerra which are free"

I was skeptical that a strip could provide month long protection for my tooth sensitivity - especially because I use an expensive $30 toothpaste for my tooth sensitivity that helps, but does not make the pain go away completely.<br /><br />After reading the instructions (they are really easy to understand and follow), I was able to use the strips with no problem. I was easily able to place them (pretty quickly) and they did not bother me at all. I actually find it pretty easy to put them on during my drive to work.  I have to say, after the first treatment, I did not notice really any difference. After I did the second treatment two weeks later, I felt no pain whatsoever when drinking cold water. We keep most of our drinking water cold so it has always bothered me but I was shocked that I felt nothing. I had to drink it a few different times to confirm, but I no longer felt any tooth pain! I was skeptical so I have tried other things that before bothered my teeth, like hot foods and ice water and although there is a slight pain, it is NOTHING compared to how badly it was before the strips.<br /><br />I am seriously in love with this product now. I only have one more treatment left from my free"

1892070,1516298,"sample code created by a Logitech engineer, it isn't supported, so you have to go digging around for third party software. Try Solaar.) The ergonomics... well, I'm just not sure. It's as solid as you'd expect from a Logitech product, but the mouse itself is short and high-profile, which strikes me as being problematic for people with RSIs. And the weighted scroll wheel is just plain weird -- instead of a somewhat solid click like most I've used, you can get a good half or full revolution spin with a good flick, and that can lead to a torrent of input events that can confuse the daylights out of some window managers. The variety of colors and styles is, well, frankly unnecessary, but it's there, so more power to you if you feel the need to get a specific color.<br /><br />For what it's worth, I'm not a huge fan of proprietary protocols like Unifying, and I think it only exists because Bluetooth support seems to be treated as a luxury feature. However, that does mean that using it on a Mac means taking up a USB port when there's already a perfectly good Bluetooth transceiver in pretty much every current system, removing one of the two benefits of using wireless input devices.

1893581,1789714,"sample, but for our sake the same little bottle gets picked up every episode and out comes a piece of paper with a bunch of lines from which all sorts of conclusions are drawn.  There is no mention of the hydrogen carrier gas that makes it work!  If you pick out technical inaccuracies in the CSIs or other shows, this is a must.<br /><br />MI-5 (spooks in the UK on BBC TV) takes you away from the mindless American sitcoms and quiz shows where contestants are briefed on the proper answer (in fine print) to make for artificial television.  Even so called reality TV isn't real any more on US primetime network TV.<br /><br />MI5 is the 2002 evolution of the cold war in a post 9/11 atmosphere.  Actors do not live on and on to be shot at and protected by a car door (hint bullets go through car doors like paper) in MI5.  If an MI-5 actor lasts more than 3 consecutive seasons they are not doing any field work!  MI-5 has the full gammut of actors from the ruff russian consular officer to the slick London MI5 professional, dedicated to his/her country.<br /><br />While watching you are not treated like a mindless idiot with magic tricks of the production company.  You are shown the real world of MI5 (or as close as you will ever come).  England has two agencies which parallel the FBI and CIA, called MI5 and MI6 respectively.  So you start by forming your british to american english dictionary with MI5-->FBI.  It's a show about spying inside of Britain.  Yes, vocabulary is strictly british english - you must get off the lieu to answer the tele, pull on your trousers and fill your auto with petrol, pop the bonnet<br /><br />A few times MI5 liases with MI6, the CIA from US, The russian federation, and other countries we ignore in our TV programming - even though they exist.  You'll realize that most of the action is filmed in London.  And add to your vocabulary words like the tube, underground, fish and chips, and you're on the way to realizing the accents and language used in London.<br /><br />The CIA has a wall of stars - anonymous people who died in service to the USA.  Don't expect your favorite charactor to be there at the end of the next episode.  Agents encounter lethal problems like bombs, bullets, drowning, toxins, and other spy favorites that come from real spy to spy encounters.  By the end of season 3 all the main characters are gone and season 4 begins with just the head of MI5 in position.  That wall of stars in the CIA lobby did not get there without alot of sacrifices, and MI5 is realistic to that end.<br /><br />You'll learn the skill of the dead drop, that not everyone carrys a gun nor needs to, that psycology can accomplish a mission effectively without firing a shot, but if shots are fired, people blead and sometimes die.  Again, it is realistic.  Cars are right hand drive which works well when you drive on the left side of the two lane road!  CCTV cameras cover nearly all of London central, and all cellular or landline calls are routed through echelon for word detection as part of MI5's intelligence gathering.  Car chases are far less americanized - no big V8 engines and squealing tires. MI5 works in the background using their assortment of tracking devices, Taxis which are run by MI5 with drivers that report back their drop off location, and of course the camera network to get information about a car traveling through london and convey it to the following vehicle.<br /><br />Youwill find yourself taken to foreign lands by air travel when remote intelligence is involved.  Even the insides of foreign consular offices are decorated with the proper theme of the home country.  Diplomatic pouches are carefully inspected by X-ray to determine if a manual inspection is needed.<br /><br />MI5 does take liberties on occasion - the x-ray machine which can read a stack of pages of paper and \\""print\\"" them all for review"

1895048,1484557,"sample 1-hour collection of 60 clips (mixed day and night driving) will require about 4.5GB. This means the aftermarket 64GB card I installed will have greater capacity to record (at or near 16 hours) than I have to drive in a day...<br /><br />-Streamlined user interface. The camera has just two physical control points. One is the DC power adapter (which can be connected or disconnected at either the camera or the vehicle's 12v socket). The other is the camera's manual \\""event\\"" button. You can use this to manually select a the following minute as an \\""Event\\""; this protects that minute from being automatically overwritten if the SD card reaches full capacity (and flags is with a exclamation point in the Road Hawk software video file listing). All other settings are made via the Road Hawk software on a computer and stored as a .txt configuration file on the card. Two LEDs face the driver; a red one for camera operation and a green one for GPS signal acquisition.<br /><br />-Flexible recording options: in addition to manually designating \\""event\\"" times, they can be automatically triggered via the camera's G force settings. The sensitivity settings  are also adjustable via the Road Hawk software. You can also adjust the default recording times (1 minute blocks are the default; these can be incrementally adjusted up to 30 minutes in length). You can also disable the reservation of space (25% of SD card capacity) for events, and use the entire card for \\""normal\\"" recording.<br /><br />-Outstanding software. The DC-2 install CD contains two program. One is the Road Hawk software, which integrates video, GPS, G-force, time, date and Google maps data for a comprehensive recap of vehicle activity. Also included is a trial/limited feature version of RaceRender (fixed product logos and limited customization), which can overlay additional data (including other vehicular sensors, if available) and then export these to several video formats. It will recognize the GPS data the DC-2 embeds in the video (.mp4) and offer to integrate into the project. When it does, it will leave behind a separate .txt file with the geo data in the folder with the source .mp4 file.<br /><br />-Superb user guide. This is a rarity in electronics these days. The DC-2's user guide is detailed and well-written. This is the quality of user documentation that we should expect with everything that plugs in (be sure to view the two instructional videos included on the software install CD).<br /><br />So, is the DC-2 perfect? Not totally. I encountered some things that could stand attention. Overall, these are very minor (even collectively( when considered with the tightly integrated functions the total hardware/software package offers users.<br /><br />-Hardware:<br />--I'm not crazy about the adhesive-to-windshield mount. I would have preferred an option to mount this on a weighted (friction/beanbag) mount (and I probably could improvise one with a creative application of velcro and/or duct tape. Interestingly, the DC-2 has a standard tripod mount. However, it is inexplicably (to me)  located on the top of the camera. While I might have preferred a bottom location for the tripod mount, I am successfully using an aftermarket suction cup mount (the [[ASIN:B005CMP2ZO Arkon Camera Car Mount]] on the windshield, which allows use of the the female tripod mount on the top of the camera. While I have an additional bias against suction cup windshield mounts also, I prefer that option to the adhesive type. A Road Hawk-specific suction cup mount is available (as an option under the same listing as the camera).<br />Update: over time, I've come to appreciate the utility of the OEM suction mount, which works just fine.<br /><br />-While I appreciate the simple on camera interface, a physical audio record enable/disable switch on the camera would be a huge step up. You can configure this via the software, but it's not changeable until you return the SD card to your PC and adjust the settings.<br /><br />-Software:<br />--the Road Hawk software window is not resizable. If you select the full screen option when viewing video, the associated sensor, GPS, Google maps and video file information becomes unavailable. Too bad.<br />--You'll also need to know your GMT offset to properly set the time (which is then calculated to local from the GPS data); it's unclear whether this will self-adjust at the end of daylight savings time. If not, those west of Greenwich will have to increase their offset by one hour. This isn't rocket science, but is a possible area of confusion for those not used to dealing with GMT (and the changes that occur as a result of local daylight savings changes).<br />--The Road Hawk software always defaults to the program's installation folder when you want navigate to source videos. This would be much improved as a user option to specify a default folder for it to begin navigating for source videos (or, as some programs do, persistence in remembering where you got your most recent video). This is true even if you have set your Windows options to include the Road Hawk executable to appear in a context menu as an application associated with video types. Note: the companion RaceRender program will accept video input directly from a context menu option.<br />-The RaceRender software is both powerful, and feature-dense. Users who like to explore software functions will have fun. Those who seek a more direct user experience should prepare from a learning curve.<br /><br />-These are *very* minor points in an otherwise totally outstanding partnership between capable hardware, high performing software and excellent user guide.<br /><br />Overall, the DC-2 offers one of the very best user experiences I have ever encountered in a piece of consumer electronics.<br /><br />I was provided the DC-2 for review"

1913541,847555,"sample] Epson Glossy papers and the results were nothing short; the pictures came out more than astonishing in terms of quality and one might thought it'd came from a professional lab. The ink dries instantly, there were no smudges while handling the prints. I haven't tried the CD/DVD prints but I'm expecting the results to be just as good. The only downside to it was when I tried printing on some leftover HP Premium Photo papers, the results were horrible where the inks doesn't want to dry and the colors were way off; my prints came out looking like it was from 1980 - rendering yellowish-brownish tone with sort of a sepia effect. That means I'm only limited to Epson Photo papers -- not good.  Scans: (5 Stars) Now that I can stash away (because I couldn't give it away) that slow and bulky Umax scanner (circa 1998), I was able to scan some documents from the unit itself and sent to one of the computers. I did some magazine scans, and again, the quality just blew me off my seat! The detailed contrasts were clear and sharp, the color and imaging retained true to its originals, there were no blurs and the overall results did not go darker compared to my old Umax scanner, now if it only prints this way and the overall rating would be a good 5 shining stars! The biggest plus to all this is having the option and ability to scan any document and convert them into pdf files - saves the hassle. Note: you can also do all this easily from the computer with options to tweak them any way you pleased with the included softwares.  Copier: (5 Stars) It does the job quick - in Color or B/W! The LCD control panel let's you adjust options compared to a regular professional copier from Kinkos or one from an office environment/employer. I can honestly say that this is a God-send since I needed to copy documents occasionally to have it sent off right away, whereas like before and opposed to having it manually scanned; convert the jpeg files; shrink the files and convert them into pdf and then print.  FAX: Haven't tried it, but I suspect if one were to have a valid working phone line, it should work just fine.  Oh, let's not forget: Read the manuals thoroughly and carefully so you'll know how to benefit the Artisan 810 to its fullest results, otherwise you'll just end up having a bad time with it -- and ultimately with the review"

Chocolate has always been one of my favorite foods.<br /><br />That being said, this is simply the best chocolate I've ever had the privilege to sample.  Dozens of subtle flavors dance across the tongue as each type of taste bud brings slight variations in this creamy smooth bittersweet confection.  Best experienced by sharing with a friend, although I'm sure other pairings would work well too.  Easily 5 stars for the chocolate, and the packaging is quite attractive.<br /><br />However, there is more to the experience than simply the product.

1917594,2200578,"Sample, I bought this ebook.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />- ORGANIZATION: It's organized by state, so you can jump to whatever states interest you.<br /><br />- LOTS OF MAPS: Thankfully he includes many maps, which is essential to understanding what's going on.<br /><br />- USEFUL FACTS: You end up getting (probably) all the essential explanations as to why each state is shaped the way it is.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />- KINDLE MAPS HAVE PRETTY LOW RESOLUTION: They're readable, especially if you zoom into them, but you'll often find yourself squinting. The reason they're low resolution is that Amazon charges publishers by the megabyte. Therefore, publishers are discouraged from selling books with high resolution graphics because it cuts into their profit margins. Amazon must charge publishers by the megabyte to cover the costs of its WhisperSync technology over cellular networks. (BTW, since most other ebook sellers don't have such a cellular fulfillment, they don't penalize/charge publishers by the megabyte - they get a flat % commission on every sale.)<br /><br />- REPETITIVE: Sometimes the author repeats the exact same phrase. At times it seems like he does a copy/paste. This is the downside of the way it's organized. For instance, when he explains how California got it northern border in the California chapter, he has to talk about Oregon. When you go to the Oregon chapter, you get to hear the same story when he talks about Oregon's southern border. And on and on. The upside is that you might remember the facts through repetition.<br /><br />- ANNOYING QUESTIONING STYLE: He starts every chapter with a bunch of questions (e.g., \\""Why does Delaware have that semi-circle border by New Jersey?\\""). In fact, he asks questions all over the book. At first, I liked this style since it seems conversational. But he does it so often that it gets a bit annoying.<br /><br />- LOUSY STORYTELLING: It's pretty dry and dehumanizing. There are few characters in the whole story. For example, there's a cool story about how one rich man managed to cut Idaho's northeast border down to size; I would have liked to hear much more stories like that. Instead, it's mostly about faceless bureaucrats making decisions from on-high. I suppose he addresses this complaint in his sequel: \\""How the States Got Their Shapes Too: The People Behind the Borderlines.\\"" However, it would have been better to include it all in one book. He would have one 5-star book instead of two 4-star books.<br /><br />- AUTHOR IS NEITHER A GEOGRAPHER NOR A HISTORIAN: When I bought the book, I hadn't realized that Mark Stein is neither a geographer nor a historian (which surprised me). He's a playwright and screenwriter. Although that doesn't mean he can't write a good book about the shape of our states, he loses a bit of credibility about the accuracy of what he says (as other review"

1925771,228119,"sample of the first three lessons on their site. My children have done the first four lessons (as have I).  I have wanted to draw for a while now.  I even bought a set of watercolor paints.  But, I struggled to know what to do with them.  I needed someone to show me.  I was reminded of my difficulty as I watched these videos.  There are many wonderful art curriculums that consist of a written text.  Because videos are a different medium, they  have different strengths and weaknesses, which I want to elaborate on.<br /><br />One of the greatest strength of videos is that you can actually \\""see\\"" someone create a work of art.  You can see how they move their hands and all the little steps involved (if they show them).  If you don't have access to an art teacher, or you yourself aren't experienced in teaching art, there are likely many tricks and techniques you won't be able to demonstrate.  I appreciated \\""seeing\\"" Pat's demonstration of how to hold the pencil so that you can shade.  She was very specific and clear in her directions.  I also liked her explanation of how to draw a lighter or darker line by holding the pencil differently.  I think it was very appropriate and easy to understand for children.  Other strengths of this art curriculum, which is best suited to children in grades 1-6, are that the lessons are easy to follow and simple.  The lessons build on one another.  Also, the art materials needed are inexpensive and easy to obtain.<br /><br />The one weakness of this curriculum is that the lessons don't give specific assignments to continue the techniques in the lesson.  Pat gives general assignments, but as the assistant art teacher/homeschool parent, you'll want to make specific assignments for your children.  For example, I would suggest that you repeat lesson number 2 with a different object.  I do want to note that after ten times drawing the same object for my contour dressing, my drawing still didn't look right.  Your child may have the same experience.  Lesson 4 could be repeated with another object.  If you're anything like me, write these plans into your lesson planner.  I'd also suggest that you do these lessons with your children.  Usually, when my children watch a video, I use that time to take care of other things that I need to.  In this case, that's not the best idea.  Because these lessons need practice, and additional reinforcement, you need to know what's on them.  You will learn along with your children.  I find that with every year I learn so much right alongside my children.  Many of the gaps in my own education are being filled in.<br /><br />You may wonder how my children liked the lessons.  Their reaction was a mixed one that requires explanation.  The week before I let them do these art lessons, they watched God's Runaway, another video by See The Light Shine.  They loved the story and the art that they created with one of the lessons on the DVD.  When they watched these lessons, the video wasn't as \\""entertaining\\"".  These art lessons are intended to develop foundational drawing skills in your children.  Most children, and people for that matter, want to create a work of art before they learn how to shade and draw a light or dark line.  So, as you might expect, my children thought lessons 1and 2 were \\""okay\\"".  They were expecting every lesson to be like God's Runaway.  But, bythe time we got to lesson 4, they had adjusted their thinking and really enjoyed drawing their shoes.  I think that they would enjoy it more as the lessons progressed and they were drawing more pictures.  The first few lessons just happen to be very basic--and needed!  The great thing about the lessons is that they are short and work well with multiple ages at the same time.  If you're having a hard time fitting art into your schedule--whether because of time or expensive supplies, these videos could be a great fit for your family.<br /><br />Using an art curriculum, or any curriculum really, needs input and ideas from the parent to make it fit for your family.  I let my children watch the first two lessons on their own.  I shouldn't have done that.  I watched the fourth lesson with them.  We paused the video when we needed to and I explained and reinforced what the art teacher was instructing them to do.  My older daughter wanted to rush and not really \\""look\\"" closely at the contours of her shoe.  I encouraged her to slow down and take time to \\""look\\"" at it as she drew.  You may find that it is helpful to watch it through once and then draw together.  Or you may find that it is most helpful to pause the video several times during the lesson and discuss what the teacher is talking about.  I would definitely say that it was helpful for my children to see me drawing alongside them and explaining to them what curves I saw in my shoe.<br /><br />When I'm considering curriculum for my children, I have a couple of priorities:  1) Will it teach them what I want them to know?  2  Is it doable or will it feel burdensome?  3  Does it appeal to me--do I want to teach it?  If I don't, I will put it off every day.  4  Do I think my children will enjoy it and will they be able to learn well from this curriculum?  5  Will it fit in our budget?  Number 4 is a conversation for another day, but when it comes to art I want my children to really enjoy it.  It is not an academic subject in my eyes.  I've addressed the other questions in this review"

I broke my regular glasses a short time back, and I've been waiting for the replacement pair.  In the mean time, I was trying to replace a light bulb in a flashlight I own.  The specs of the bulb were engraved into the base, and trying to read the specs was impossible.  But with the Tasco, I popped the bulb under 10x magnification and I was off to the races.  That's probably not a standard use case for a microscope, but it certainly worked for me...<br /><br />The Tasco 120x USB-Equipped Digital Microscope is best described as a toy, but it's something that could be much more in the hands of someone with a little imagination.

Most- not at all.<br /><br />My advice would be to spend a few more dollars and get a bigger bag with more protection.  I spent about $20 more than this bag is going for and got a much nicer bag. It's not so big that I am at all hesitant to carry it.  But, it's big enough that I feel it will serve me well for a few years.dn't have a size that matched my screen exactly- so I had to custom trim mine.

1942207,517247,"sample pack of about 10 4 x 6 sheets. If you're wondering what it is specifically, it is the [[ASIN:B0014WJYOG Canon Photo Paper Plus Glossy II, 4 x 6 Inches, 100 Sheets (2311B023)]]. Having printed photos dozens of times at CVS, Walgreens, and Walmart, the quality of the photos are as good as ones you get professionally done. HOWEVER, there are a few things I need to point out.<br />1. This printer is a 9600 maximum dpi printer. The higher the dpi when you print photos on photo quality paper, the higher the detail.<br />2. When you print photos, you need EXCELLENT quality photos AKA straight from the digital camera or high megapixel camera. My wife tried to print a couple photos she pulled from Facebook. They looked absolutely horrible due to the compression that Facebook does by default unless you check the option to upload in high resolution. This option is *ONLY* available on Facebook's webpage. The mobile versions do not allow you to do this. Because of that, the majority of floating facebook photos out there are not in high quality. Again, the artifacts (square blocks, uneven colors/detail) from compression (like the photos on facebook) will be very very visible when you print on high resolution and/or photo paper.<br /><br />Other printing features (such as templates) are bundled in the application (on the setup CD) and also on built into the printer itself. Such templates include the following: calendars, photo albums, lined papers (such as notebook paper, graph paper, checklist paper, agendas, etc).<br /><br />[ OTHER FEATURES ]<br />Google Cloud Print - This is fairly a new technology and even myself, a frequent user of Google technologies, rarely use this. I just don't see it as useful to print to my home printer when I'm not home unless I really needed something printed. Regardless, this model printer says it doesn't support Google Cloud Print, but there are ways around it if you set it up on your Google account. Of course by doing that, you have to leave your PC on and always connected to the Internet.<br /><br />Apple Airprint - Having 2 iPhones and an iPad in the house, printing from the Apple devices makes printing more accessible. Because this printer supports Airprint, it automatically shows up on your Apple devices as long as you set up the PIXMA printer on your local home network AND your Apple devices are on the same network.<br /><br />[ COPYING / SCANNING ]<br />Scanning is pretty good. We scanned a couple photographs just to test and it seemed to be good quality. It's really easy.<br />Copying is a snap. You put the document on the scanner, close the lid, and then press to either copy in black or color. Not much easier than that.<br /><br />[ IMPORTANT NEED-TO-KNOWS TO SAVE INK ]<br />Not sure if they were engineered this way (I've seen other Canon printers in the past do this), but by default, regardless of if you print in black only (say a report for school), black colors come from mixing your color cartidges together. So when you read review"

1945925,286847,"sample I received didn't operate correctly so the very knowledgeable customer support lady said they would ship a replacement overnight. Sure enough, the replacement arrived next day, even before I had shipped the first unit. Configuring the scan function required a call to customer support, but as others have reported, the Epson tech support person was very knowledgeable and walked me through that part of the setup without any trouble at all.<br /><br />As a printer, the 810 is just excellent. The pre-made Epson printer profiles are okay if you're not too critical, but with a custom made printer profile the 810 produces prints, up to 8X10 (A4) size which are every bit as good as those from the R1800 - and that's very high praise indeed.<br /><br />This is a great printer, from a great company. I paid a little more for my unit than the current price. At the current price, this printer is probably the best bargain available in printers - really, it's a steal! As for ink usage, all the high end photo printers for us \\""enthusiastic amateurs\\"" use ink - but the 810 at least has large-capacity ink cartridges available.<br /><br />Just buy it! You can't possibly go wrong.<br /><br />UPDATE JULY 20 2010 - I've had the Artisan 810 for over four months now, and I still think it's one of the best printer bargains anywhere. EPSON TECH SUPPORT has been superb too. At one point I thought my 810 was having paper feed problems. Tech support was readily available, polite, well informed, and helped me resolve the problem (which was due to my own misunderstanding of how to position the paper, not due to anything wrong with the printer. The one thing I caution photo enthusiasts about is that the Claria ink has more than the usual amount of metamerism - prints which look perfect under one lighting condition may look very different under other lights. Otherwise, this is an excellent photo printer as well as a dependable workhorse all-in-one.<br /><br />UPDATE DEC 26 2010 - I can't imagine what's going on with the people who wrote negative review"

1953504,2321962,"sample selection of eartips, but all too often we findproducts that when a simple part wears out, one has to throw that product away because there are no replacement parts. For the Plantronics Voyager PRO-series this is not the case, as when the eartips wear out, they are easily replaceable. In my case the [[ASIN:B002QBS9KE Medium Eartips for Voyager Pro]] were the perfect fit, but your findings may be different.<br /><br />Trial Run in the Field:<br /><br />Decided to give this second Voyager PRO+ headset a good trial run in some congested areas where there would be plenty of noise, and where I could test not just the reception but the noise cancellation qualities as well, and what better to test it than a busy city street on a moderately windy early spring day.  As I found from previous experiences with the older version, the people with whom I was talking had no problem hearing me, nor did I have any difficulty hearing them. But the sound quality of the replacement Voyager PRO+ headset is not quite the same as the first one, which is somewhat confusing. It's about equal to the sound quality of the original Plantronics Voyager PRO, but not any better.<br /><br />Using it in normal conversations during that trial run was boringly normal.  One person thought that I sounded \\""clearer than normal\\"" but that might have been their phone as well.  I \\""wore\\"" the headset for a little over eight hours straight, made a few calls, but most of this was in standby mode. Found it to be extremely comfortable, and for the most part wasn't even aware that it was there.  It's worth noting that it didn't interfere with wearing glasses at all, a strong plus for this user.<br /><br />Regular Use:<br /><br />The Plantronics Voyager PRO+ has become an item that I use daily.  It's far more comfortable and ergonomic than the photos might indicate, which is something that one can only find by actual extended use. Have worn mine for 12+ hours a day at a time, and it's been quite easy to adapt to over extended periods of time, with no discomfort whatsoever.  I ride a mountain bike some distances over suburban streets and wooded trails on a regular basis each week, and the first thing that callers notice is that the sound quality is excellent.<br /><br />But this Voyager PRO+ seems to not deal with wind noise as well as my original Voyager PRO, or the earlier Voyager PRO+ that this current one replaced, even fiddling with the volume controls and the settings on my BlackBerry. It's acceptable, but there is a difference. Maybe it's just this particular unit.<br /><br />Out of curiosity I did try out Vocalyst feature, where one could use voice commands to have email and text messages read back. Gmail with the BlackBerry was fine and reasonably easy to set up.  Tried it with Twitter feeds and Facebook as well, but for only a few minutes as it seemed too distracting.  It may just be me, and your experience may differ from mine.  Personally I found the Vocalyst feature to be more of a novelty than anything, though friends who use it while driving like it.  I don't like using cell phones while driving, especially considering all of the various local laws against it.  Again, it's a personal thing, and worth checking out even if only to explore the available features.<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Have had this second [[ASIN:B0043EV20G Plantronics Voyager PRO+ Bluetooth Headset]] as a replacement for the one lost a couple of months now and have subjected it to more use than the average product that I might review"

Well yes, but with the MicroGage 1-2-3 you can dial in the height of every bit setting, and if you do an oops on a piece sometime after routing it, you can come back to that bit setting with dead on accuracy by simply dialing in your setting.<br /><br />I could go on for hours explaining the advantages of having a perfectly squared block with an .001\\"" micro gage attached to it, but let me just mention a few.<br /><br />Setting up your jointer, to not only be able to quickly check the in feed and out feed tables, that they are co-planar, but also being able to more easily set the jointer blades to the proper height. I find it challenging to use a straight edge off of the out feed table to set the blades, there is always a little creep where the blade, spring loaded and at an off angle, wants to move into a further slight off angle under the straight edge, and after tightening, you find that it is set too high. Then you have to do it over again. With the Micro Gage you already know the setting, so you can leave the gage sitting on the blade, and have your other hand free"

1957743,1108135,"sample paper pack (consisting on two sheets only)<br />Power cord<br />Telephone cord<br />**Note a USB cable is NOT included and may be required**<br /><br />I recently gave away my old HP printer/scanner since I was not really using it anymore, printouts, scans and copies if rarely needed, I can make at work. As expected, just after giving it away my kid starts getting homework that requires us to print stuff for him as well as make copies of documents and the like. So we were searching for a new multifunctional just when we were offered to try this Epson WorkForce 635. I work a lot with Photoshop so the scanner was indeed something I needed in our new multifunctional.<br /><br />The picture in the Amazon product description page doesn't really do justice to the real size of this unit, it is bigger than it looks in the pictures but not too large to worry about space. It looks pretty nice and well constructed, my only concern would be the paper load tray as the guides in it do not feel tight in place and may come loose when handling them if you are not careful.<br /><br />Unpacking it and setting it up was very easy but a little time consuming though. It took me about 35 minutes to have it ready to be used, from the initial setup to the final printing tests once all the updated drivers were downloaded and installed. The downloads were real fast with my internet connection, what was really taking longer periods of time was the install process of each updated driver (running on a laptop with Windows XP) Other than that, a very simple setup process. The Wi-Fi setup had to be one of the easiest things to do, even though the manual suggests you set it up using a USB cable (conveniently NOT included) I went the 'hard' way using the Wi-Fi setup process which worked like a charm. Once in my network all PCs linked to it had access to the WorkForce 635 (obviously the drivers need to be installed before using it) The test page that it prints has this compass drawing in it next to the Epson logo and it printed perfectly, no additional adjustments were needed at first.<br /><br />After the initial setup we have been able to use it without any problems, what we use the most for now is the printer, which delivers high quality printouts in both color and b&w. The double sided printing is a paper saver and does not need you to be there manually switching the pages. Another functionality that surprised me was the duplex scanning, if you have documents that are printed on both sides of the page and wish to scan them both, the WorkForce 635 will do it for you! This may not be something new to this type of devices but it was new for me! The copier also delivers very nice results in both color and b&w and does indeed print text pages really fast. The fact that this is a wireless device, unlike our old HP multifunctional, is just incredible and makes it easier to use, no need to be in the same room and have cables on your desk!<br /><br />Now, when printing pictures in photo paper, quality suffers a little bit, nothing to worry about really but if you are as picky as I am, you will notice it. I made a full page photo print on special HP photo glossy paper and after about 5 minutes I had a high quality looking printout on my hands, but noticed that there were subtle differences in the color, the blue sky, for example, looked pale compared to the original color in the .jpg file and I was surprised to a see a couple lines across the picture, quite visible on light colored spots of the picture. Obviously, the printer needs to be adjusted and that translates on ink wasted, something of concern since the WorkForce 635 does not seem to allow third party ink to be used without giving you a lot of problems (according to problems documented in the web in regards to this model)<br /><br />There's plenty of functionalities in this unit to be tested, I personally configured the fax but have not used it to provide details about its performance as a fax machine, I will eventually update the review"

1962747,423531,"sample turned out to be defective  after about a month. (That can happen to anything.) Oki Customer Support shipped me a refurbished unit overnight and mailed me a lable to ship the defective unit back. Fedex would even come and pick it up. <br /> <br />While getting a refurbished unit was expected, it came with no consumables...toner, drums, fuser and belt. No problem with this printer, tho, because the top opens and everything comes out and back in easily. So swapping everything from one to the other was easy and I was back up and running in no time. <br /> <br />This is where I had a minor problem. The defective printer had less than 300 pages on it. The replacement had a page count of more than 3000. The printer (as most do) judges the life of all consumables based on the page count, so my 99% full toner cartridges were now detected to be only 67% full with a corrosponding decrease in the remaining life of the belt, fuser, and drums. Since this printer will stop working when it thinks it is out of toner, I would have to replace all toners when they still have 1/3 of their life left in them! (The older firmware version of the replacement printer was a minor issue.) <br /> <br />I called Customer Service back with the above concerns. They said there was no way to reset the page count on the printer after servicing, but they agreed to my concerns. They sent me a brand new printer (also overnight) with all new consumables. Fedex came and took the old one away a couple of days later. <br /> <br />The new printer has been running satisfactorily for about 4 months now with no problem. I print mostly on regular 20 lb paper but have done business card stock, Avery lables, check stock, envelopes, and card stock. I have even used lables and envelopes that said \\""inkjet only not for laser printers\\"" with no problems using both the standard tray and the multipurpose tray. The instructions suggest using the straight thru method for envelopes, card stock, and lables, but all come out fine making the turn thru the normal path. <br /> <br />Contrary to the whining in the previoius post about all the toners running out at once...that is not likely. Depending on your usage, the black will be out first. The others will likely last a lot longer. As far as price, the cost of one black cartridge is far less than the 7 inkjet cartridges (At $30 ea.)I would need for the same 5000 pages on my HP 6540 inkjet. <br /> <br />As an aside, the price of consumables is comparable with other color lasers. If you use the cost of consumables as a basis, the 7 injet cartridges far exceeds the cost of that printer, too. (Not factoring in color ones.) <br /> <br />I do mostly black and white printing and have the defaults set to only use the black cartridge in draft mode. (Still good quality for most uses.) This extends the life of the color toners. The default settings are easy to set using the front panel controls. <br /> <br />The shiny printing takes some getting used to, but I can live with it. <br /> <br />The color pictures (graphics and photographs) I have done have looked good, tho not as good as a good inkjet, but from reading other review"

While I prefer to create my own settings, the automatic setting makes smart choices  Images are clear and colors are vibrant before any editing.  The camera is lightweight with a comfortable grip.  The weight of pro cameras is really a disadvantage to me.  I hate lugging one around.  The 30x zoom works fine with no notable blur when handheld in full daylight.

Fractal is obviously made up of high-caliber musicians, but I would be interested to see how these arrangements are performed.  There is a lot of vertical depth and complexity that would be difficult for a trio to perform.  If they are as true to these recordings as King Crimson's are to theirs, Fractal is indeed worthy of respect.<br />The lowdown:  I dislike mentioning another band's name in a review"

I have found very few books that I wanted that were not available in Kindle form. If they don't have it available, you can click on \\""tell this publisher you'd like to read this in Kindle version\\"" -don't know how long that would take, but I'm sure this product and the popularity of it are making publishers take note.<br /><br />Okay, the other thing that I think is really cool is the reduced price of the Kindle version books. Most are $9.99 or under. Whereas you could pay $16 - $28 for the paper version. No shipping charges, running out to the store, etc. You get to begin reading the book instantly. I LOVE that! Also, even if you remove the book from your Kindle to make space for more, you can always download it again from your personal library stored on Amazon.<br /><br />Also, another benefit is that in accessing Amazon right from your Kindle, you can read book/product review"

So I just dropped the pheromone thing onto a random sticky part of the triangle and figure that will get the job done. But it was a bit odd that they sent me a defective unit without instructions. So if you get a similar one, just drop the pheromone square onto the sticky part somewhere, and it will work well enough. And in general, I'd either recommend the \\""Revenge\\"" brand because it uses less packaging (more environmentally friendly), or whichever of the two brands is cheaper that day.them to be equally effective, though I generally go with Revenge because I can usually find it for less money, and like that it uses less packaging so it's more environmentally friendly.<br /><br />For some reason, in the free"

There is only a slight aftertaste and none of the strong whey protein taste than many protein powders have. If you're not a fan of Gatorade drinks you would probably want to pass this one up regardless and try some of the other Nectar flavors instead. You can find my review"

I wound up replacing it with a $19 Qualitus bidet I purchased here on Amazon.  And it works great because it is very simple in design.  I found the seat heat wasn't necessary.  And the blow dryer would take 10 to 15 minutes to dry my butt and became painful due to the exposure to the heated air for that long.  The $19 one has much more pressure and cleans in less than 30 seconds whereas the Swash was much lower pressure and took 2 to 4 minutes (2 minutes each time you cycle it on).  I just didn't know better when I purchased this being a first time user of this type device.  Now that I know I wanted to pass along the wisdom to any who want it.YOU WILL BE SORRY.<br /><br />UPDATE: 2-7-14<br /><br />We received the repaired first seat back in a battered box that had quite a few labels stuck on over top each other and the corners crushed in.  Took the seat out and installed it and guess what?  More problems.  This time the seat sensor didn't work and the thing shot out water when the wash button was pushed whether anyone was on the seat or not.  I contacted Brondell customer service and they had me run through some diagnostic procedures to re-set the seat sensor feature.  Hope this is all over with and I can finally use my $600 seat for a change.  Again, if you are considering a bidet toilet seat you may wish to look elsewhere.  And I have no guarantee that what I have will work for more than several weeks without problems again.  I've owned this since the middle of October and have had it back and forth more than I've had use of it.  Good grief.  Can't anyone make anything that works anymore.  Or at least check it before they ship out.<br /><br />I was told that during the repair and testing"

You could listen to a lot of music if you switch off the screen, which consumes a lot of power. It gets a bit hot underneath when the unit is charging, a bit less hot when it is running, but nothing too uncomfortable.<br /><br />The device has a resistive screen, which means that one has to push a bit hard to get a response. This is as opposed to the capacitive screen found in the iPhone, for example, which is requires less effort. I found that I had to swipe my finger a couple of times on many occasions to get a response. I don't know if this is due to slow computer response or the screen. It is sufficient for the needs of the device, but may bother some people.<br /><br />The documentation was VERY minimal, just a few pages with some of the basics. It came nowhere near explaining how to use most of the features of the device.<br /><br />Functionality:<br /><br />The device runs Android, which is a Linux derived OS. It works well, but for someone coming from a Windows environment it will take some time to get used to. The home screen has three \\""windows\\"" for holding icons; one swipes the finger left and right to go between screens. A small tab slides out to reveal the applications installed.<br /><br />It plays media files well and synchronizes with the latest Windows Media player - so if you use the media player on your PC, your files will be transferred when you sync.<br /><br />The web browser is a custom built offshoot of Google Chrome, and works OK but is a bit basic. I liked the way they offered a multi-window view of open pages.<br /><br />The device includes access to the Archos \\""Applib\\"", which has maybe 500 applications, and has a number of good games available for download, all free"

I enjoyed playing with those on the WB150F, but they seem out of place here.  There are a superb number of image adjustments, exposure tweaks, and  controls of a more serious nature as well. When you want to get serious, this camera is ready.  Also, some of  the fun things, like the Panorama mode, do work well if you understand their limitations and keep your expectations reasonable.<br /><br />As expected, the APS-C sensor renders a lot of good image detail. This is the big plus for this camera. I was very pleased with the results under good lighting conditions.  I shoot a lot of landscape and street stuff, and this camera seems well suited for that.  The noise reduction seems to work well up to about 1600 or so (maybe 800 for purists).  Colors are accurate and not over-saturated like on many consumer cameras.  If you like the \\""boost\\"" many cameras give by default, there is a \\""Vivid\\"" mode which will do this for you.  Personally, I prefer the more realistic colors (one of the things I like about Olympus and (most) Panasonics as well). Sharpness is good in JPEGs (I have not shot RAW yet) and tones are nice and smooth (think large expanses of blue sky and clouds).  I'm sure with experience my results will improve over these initial test shots, so that bodes well.  If you like to print big, 16x20, even 20x30 possibly, you will be able to do so, which is very nice.<br /><br />The 20-50mm kit lens is nice enough, but has a very limited range compared to what I am used to.  (I am considering getting the 30mm lens which I think would make a nice compact package for everyday use.)  However, the images look good, sharp, detailed, so I am happy with it.  Video worked well and the zoom worked fine in video mode and was silent.  In casual use, there is no need to switch the dial to video mode, you can just press the Video button on the back and after a slight pause you're in action.  This is nice.  Of course, dialing to full video mode gives you more options.<br /><br />Wifi features worked fine, I was able to easily connect and save pics using the autobackup mode.  Skydrive and others worked fine.  Have not tried the mobile link and remote view finder apps yet. (Update:  I tried these apps out and they worked OK for the most part.  A bit flaky at times.  There is a new \\""Smart Camera app\\"" to replace these, but it only works with the new firmware.  Since I have not yet upgraded the firmware, have not tried it.)  The PC_Autobackup mode works very well for transferring pics and movies to your PC.  It remembers what has been transferred and only transfers new items.  Best to transfer frequently, since slower than reading from a card, but all automatic and very convenient.  [You can also transfer photos to your mobile devices (phone/tablet) using the other apps (Mobile Link/Smart Camera).]<br /><br />Example: You get back from shooting, you activate the PC-Autobackup on the camera (your laptop/PC and network must be on, of course), and the camera will connect and begin transferring your content.  When done the camera will turn-off (unless you press a control button within 30 seconds) and you can set the PC to shutdown as well if you like.  Or you can select the \\""open folder\\"" choice on the PC/notenook popup dialog and view your pics and movies.  All very easy and convenient.<br /><br />There is a \\""Smart Range\\"" feature to extend  dynamic range and preserve highlights.  It seems to work well, but you lose shadow detail. Might want to turn off by default, I think.  (You can also shoot RAW and tweak things  yourself, of course.)<br /><br />JPEGS look very good to me with a lot of detail and sharpness.  So good that I think shooting JEPG only is feasible with the NX1000.  (You can always switch to RAW or RAW+Jpeg when needed, of course.)  I think many will find the Jpegs entirely adequate for most purposes.  (If you shoot a lot at high ISO's you would definitely want to shoot RAW.)  You have a range of aspect ratios including 1:1, 3:2, and 16:9.  This is nice and gives you flexibility in camera versus cropping later.<br /><br />The 8fps burst mode worked very well, though as has been noted everywhere, there is a lag as the camera processes the shots before you can shoot again.  I am a fairly deliberate photographer and don't shoot much action/sports, so the NX1000 is fine for me.  The occasional lags when switching modes and after bursts or RAW shots are not an issue for me, but could be for some.  It's all covered in many of the excellent online review"
94813,3378517,"unit given the well-publicized problems of Windows Backup to access 2TB+ drives.  I was hoping the Seagate software would make the backup process seamless.  In that regard, the Seagate software is a failure.  The Seagate Dashboard (the packaged software that arrives with the unit) is very, very basic.  It's only designed for copying simple/basic files.  It has no ability to create full system images that can be used to recover a failed drive (i.e. complete with operating system, etc.).  The software will not allow you to locate or copy system files or hidden files.  This is a big negative.  For somebody that simply wants a plug-and-play package that will allow them to pretty easily backup pictures, video files, Office docs, etc., this will probably fill the bill, but for anybody looking for a \\""complete\\"" backup solution this definitely isn't it.<br /><br />Notwithstanding these negatives, for $135 I don't consider the purchase to be a failure.  Why?  Simply put, the hardware itself is pretty nice.  USB 3.0 is very, very quick (I installed a WD USB 3.0 PCIe card, also bought from Amazon) compared to the old 2.0.  The unit itself is compact, nice looking, and seems quite sturdy.  It runs a little on the hot side (115-120 degrees F after working for a while), but within the realm of reasonability.<br /><br />Once I decided to ditch the Seagate software, I tried out a bunch of different backup programs.  For my benchmark purposes, I was backup up about 600GB of mixed data, video, and music files.  Seagate Dashboard and Windows Backup both took 6-7 hours.  Some of the available free"

130423,1045392,"product was sent to me initially and it would not pair.  The manufacturer sent another and it paired immediately.  That is great customer service.<br /><br />As a lantern, it works fine.  Weighing almost a pound, backpackers might wonder about this weight, but for car-camping or picnicking, it's not an issue.  The light is bright with two settings.  There is a half circled hook on top for hanging which is nice, as the light also emits from the bottom as well as the sides.  The sides with the coil are covered with a mesh which looks rather fragile.  Even if the mesh ripped, the light would not be affected that much.  It can also be collapsed so only the bottom light is shown. It's a nice little gimmick.<br /><br />The on/off button is next to the volume up/down and the switch for radio.  The radio reception was sketchy, but this is going to depend on where you are.  Incoming phone calls can also be taken with this device, with the call coming in and the music shutting off temporarily.  The Bluetooth speaker produces a clear, crisp sound with good highs and medium mid-range.  The bass is not very strong, as the wattage is only 3.7.  With 6 watts, this speaker would really rock.  As it is, with volume full on my iPhone and the speaker, there was no distortion.  Some people only want light ambient background music and this is fine for that.  There is a TF Card slot for those who want to simply listen without Bluetooth.  These are always a nice feature/option to have.<br /><br />One thing lacking is a female input 3.5mm plug.  With no double-ended 3.5mm male/male plug there is no option for other exterior music sources.<br /><br />It took about two hours to fully charge and I have not played it through long enough to know the battery time.  It should be at least 1.0-1.5 hours on a medium/low level of sound.  This will vary greatly with the loudness.<br /><br />The price is very reasonable for this size speaker and the additional lantern. It would make a great gift or stocking stuffer for the average person (not an audiophile).  Product supplied for review"

155740,3178370,"unit provided by Kingstonf Monster Cable's marketing machine. When I asked them how they intended to differentiate their drives, he said that their packaging and bundle would set them apart. The thing is, Kingston's already done that with the HyperX upgrade kit.  PERFORMANCE  The Kingston HyperX 120GB SSD was awesome inside a current MacBook Pro 13-inch laptop, and this was before I even upgraded the firmware to the latest version (3.3.2). Boot up times were reduced significantly, programs loaded almost instantly, and it ran stable for three straight weeks. Unfortunately, the MacBook Pro's display crapped out before I could run my benchmarks. To run my benchmarks, I ended up installing the HyperX to a desktop system with native SATA III ports on a Z68 motherboard.  ATTO Disk Benchmark  ATTO tests the raw performance of a drive and is the benchmark tool normally used when manufacturers advertise read/write performance.  The HyperX 120GB SSD achieved max read speeds of 559MB/s and max write speeds of 518MB/s.  CrystalDiskMark  CrystalDiskMark is a commonly used benchmark that can test performance of drives using random, incompressible data. Using incompressible data to measure performance can reveal the benefits of the faster, synchronous NAND flash, that the HyperX SSD uses. Many value-oriented SSDs use slower, asynchronous NAND flash.  Read performance was exceptional at 489MB/s. SSD drives that use asynchronous memory can't keep up with the HyperX when using incompressible data. Write performance on the HyperX 120GB SSD was good as well (161MB/s), but the difference wasn't as pronounced as it was in read performance.  SUPPORT & WARRANTY  The Kingston support website provides a good bit of information on the HyperX SSD. You can download the install guide, a data sheet, and recent firmware revisions. Beyond that, the website also has a good FAQ section and a form you can fill out for support questions. Kingston warranties the HyperX SSD for 3 years.  CONCLUSION  The Kingston HyperX 120GB SSDupgrade kit is a very attractive bundle. Its high-end performance, visual appeal, and matching accessories, make the HyperX stand out. Gamers and performance enthusiasts should be extremely happy with the HyperX SSD upgrade kit. At about a $15 premium over the standard HyperX 120GB SSD, the upgrade kit is well worth the cost difference. If you're looking for a sweet-looking SSD with sweet performance to match, take a look at the Kingston HyperX 120GB SSD upgrade kit.  * Review"

I started on the 5G network but ended up back on the main one as the signal dropped often.<br />The controls are very accurate, and I would recommend using an iPad or larger tablet rather than your cell phone to get the most out of this toy, as the cell phone screen is a little small.<br />The drone is very well made, and certainly stands up to some punishment, It really does jump too!

194018,907100,"unit got a lock as soon as I had a decent patch of clear sky. It didn't lock in between tall buildings on the walk to the gym. But once in a little more of clear area it did. It then held the lock really well. I won't know the extent of how good until I can look at the data on their website. It did lose signal in the overpass stairwell. I can see on my run map that it goofed up. That would be where the footpod would help.<br /><br />- Pace: The pace seemed to be right on. I did a 4.75 mile run and had to walk a few times. The pace was on target from what I do on the treadmill, so that was cool.<br />- Heat rate: The unit comes with a chest strap for heat rate. It got a really good connection and my heart rate was right on what I'm used to it being on the treadmill.<br />- There are preset \\""activities\\"" I just used the Road Run. It automatically reset the lap counter at each mile mark and told me the pace. That was cool. You can adjust these things and add a pacer and this is all setup through the unit itself.<br />- The pace will be a great motivator for me. I love instant feedback"

195009,2037630,"unit offers you a nice balance between features and price.<br /><br />Some of the great things are:<br />- Screen size of 4.3 inches, a must to be able to see your route clearly<br /><br />- Size of unit, slim easy to mount and carry with you in your pocket<br /><br />- Routing, having used Magellan and Tom Tom in addition to Garmin I prefer Garmin routing the most followed by Magellan and Tom Tom. However, each one has its quirks. Garmin says \\""recalculating\\"" if you take a wrong turn while Magellan just reroutes without even telling you that you missed the original route. Also Magellan tends to warn you to take an exit sooner than Garmin in some cases which can be nice. Overall, with each map update, I find Garmin giving me some funny routes, like it will tell you to take an exit off the highway and then bring you back to the same highway. So using common sense always helps when going to a new place. It can also get confused sometimes in down town areas where many roads are often one way so keeping eyes and ears open is helpful. However it's no worse than any other GPS system out there. The turn by turn voice directions with street names are nice as you never have to look at the screen if you don't want to.<br /><br />- Bluetooth - Very user friendly, loads your complete phonebook and shows you all missed calls etc. just like your phone screen. Taking a call is easy and audio quality is fair<br /><br />- You can upload Custom POIs/ way points using POI Loader software. A lot of POIs are also available free"

199370,1121701,"product gets spilled. The lids break off after a while. The plastic is rather thin and cracks easily.  Here's my MAJOR complaint with these cubies - they are a pain to wash. If you put them in the dishwasher, they are light weight and toss around all over the shelf. Half of them come out unclean because they turned over and filled with water and the food residue from other dishes is still evident, so they have to be rewashed. I ended up hand washing a large number of them each time because they kept flipping over in the dishwasher.  My other big complaint with these is that they are not air tight. So, if you want to travel and take some cubes with you for baby, you will have to put them in something else. Once the product thaws, you'll have a big mess in your carrier. Not my cup of tea. There's another brand of baby food cups on Amazon that have individual, round containers and seal-tight green lids. I thought about buying those, but couldn't find the information as to whether they were BPA free"

Despite the fact that it states you can put whole apples through the tube without having to cut them, once you do this the machine rocks like crazy and shuts off.  It obviously can't handle whole apples despite the fact that there is a big sticker on it with a picture of an apple indicating that you can put a whole one through the feeder. Even when I cut the apples, the machine still rocks a little.  Also, other times it shut off just from me putting bunches of leafy greens like spinach and kale through the feeder.  The first time I used it, it let off a burning smell so bad that I thought it was going to blow up.  I brushed it off as maybe this happened because it was the first use.  I am soooo disappointed and sad that I have to return it because 1.

Most likely I'll end up switching it out when I get a new Smart TV over the Holidays and run everything directly into the TV, so even less clutter.<br /><br />As is, it's ok, would I buy it, probably not, is the speed much better, not really.  Is the security situation good, not so much. (Network is not able to be secure as much as I like)  So with that being said  - 3 stars.

221996,2827125,"unit gets unplugged, it goes to cool mode with the temperature set at 69 degrees.  You cannot change that without the remote control.  There is a place to hang the remote control on the backside of the unit.    The unit is fairly light and compact for a portable air conditioner.  There are a few that are smaller and a few that are lighter.    It is the quietest one I have heard.  However, the 36 dB that they claim is when the fan is on low.  When on \\""Maga cool\\"", the unit is pretty loud.  Not so loud that you have to jack up the sound on your TV, but loud enough that it could bother you if you were a light sleeper.      The installation kit is well made and sturdy.  It can go into windows up to 48\\"" wide (double hung) or tall (slider).  Some other units only have kits for up to 38\\"".  Unless you have something unique about your window, you can install this in about 30 minutes.   This unit won't work on one of my windows because the hose hits a shutter frame.

231235,408925,"unit supplied yet - will report back on that. Videographers might note that there is an external mike that works with the hotshoe and uses no cables at all, nice!<br /><br />In general, I find the NX1000/1100 easy to use, the manual focus works well, the Smart mode seems to do fairly well, there are a great many scene modes and other (somewhat gimmicky) features (Magic filters/frames, etc.).  I enjoyed playing with those on the WB150F, but they seem out of place here.  There are a superb number of image adjustments, exposure tweaks, and  controls of a more serious nature as well. When you want to get serious, this camera is ready.  Also, some of  the fun things, like the Panorama mode, do work well if you understand their limitations and keep your expectations reasonable.<br /><br />As expected, the APS-C sensor renders a lot of good image detail. This is the big plus for this camera. I was very pleased with the results under good lighting conditions.  I shoot a lot of landscape and street stuff, and this camera seems well suited for that.  The noise reduction seems to work well up to about 1600 or so (maybe 800 for purists).  Colors are accurate and not over-saturated like on many consumer cameras.  If you like the \\""boost\\"" many cameras give by default, there is a \\""Vivid\\"" mode which will do this for you.  Personally, I prefer the more realistic colors (one of the things I like about Olympus and (most) Panasonics as well). Sharpness is good in JPEGs (I have not shot RAW yet) and tones are nice and smooth (think large expanses of blue sky and clouds).  I'm sure with experience my results will improve over these initial test shots, so that bodes well.  If you like to print big, say 16x20, you will be able to do so, which is very nice.<br /><br />The 20-50mm kit lens is nice enough, but has a very limited range compared to what I am used to.  The 18-55mm is larger, but covers a broader range which is nice.  Both are excellent as far as image quality. However, the images look good, sharp, detailed, so I am happy with it.  Video worked well and the zoom worked OK in video mode (not as smooth as some, 20-55mm better for video I think).  In casual use, there is no need to switch the dial to video mode, you can just press the Video button on the back and after a slight pause you're in action.  This is nice.  Of course, dialing to full video mode gives you more options.<br /><br />Wifi features worked fine, I was able to easily connect and save pics using the autobackup mode.  Skydrive and others worked fine.  Have not tried the mobile link and remote view finder apps yet. (Update:  I tried these apps out and they worked OK for the most part.  A bit flaky at times.  There is a new \\""Smart Camera app\\"" to replace these, but it only works with the new firmware.  Since I have not yet upgraded the firmware, have not tried it.)  The PC_Autobackup mode works very well for transferring pics and movies to your PC.  It remembers what has been transferred and only transfers new items.  Best to transfer frequently, since slower than reading from a card, but all automatic and very convenient.  [You can also transfer photos to your mobile devices (phone/tablet) using the other apps (Mobile Link/Smart Camera).]<br /><br />Example: You get back from shooting, you activate the PC-Autobackup on the camera (your laptop/PC and network must be on, of course), and the camera will connect and begin transferring your content.  When done the camera will turn-off (unless you press a control button within 30 seconds) and you can set the PC to shutdown as well if you like.  Or you can select the \\""open folder\\"" choice on the PC/notenook popup dialog and view your pics and movies.  All very easy and convenient.<br /><br />There is a \\""Smart Range\\"" feature to extend  dynamic range and preserve highlights.  It seems to work well, but you lose shadow detail. Might want to turn off by default, I think.  (You can also shoot RAW and tweak things  yourself, of course.)<br /><br />JPEGS look very good to me with a lot of detail and sharpness.  So good that I think shooting JEPG only is feasible with the NX1000.  (You can always switch to RAW or RAW+Jpeg when needed, of course.)  I think many will find the Jpegs entirely adequate for most purposes.  (If you shoot a lot at high ISO's you would definitely want to shoot RAW.)  You have a range of aspect ratios including 1:1, 3:2, and 16:9.  This is nice and gives you flexibility in camera versus cropping later.<br /><br />The 8fps burst mode worked very well, though as has been noted everywhere, there is a lag as the camera processes the shots before you can shoot again.  I am a fairly deliberate photographer and don't shoot much action/sports, so the NX1000/1100 is fine for me.  The occasional lags when switching modes and after bursts or RAW shots are not an issue for me, but could be for some.  It's all covered in many of the excellent online review"

So far, I have had no need to clean the pads yet.<br /><br />This unit can be an excellent addition to pain management, but I would not rely on this unit by itself.  Prior to purchasing, I would suggest a little research on TENS units and make sure that you do not have a condition that would prohibit using one.  I can personally attest that the unit worked well in eliminating pain due to tendonitis for a short period of time.while to get used to and I felt it was an annoying way to gauge the power level of the unit.<br /><br />The sensation when you are using it is a similar to someone tapping on you firmly with their finger.  This unit is not strong enough to be painful, but the sensation is different.  On levels 4 and 5, there is enough current to cause involuntary muscle contractions.  I would freak the kids out by attaching the unit to my elbow and turning it on high, causing my fingers to twitch in rhythm with the electrical pulses.<br /><br />Personally, I had success with the unit.  A single 15 minute session would eliminate the pain in my elbow.  However, the pain relief for me was fairly short lived.  I would be pain free"

281092,1521693,"unit provides (meaning I could get reception of stations several miles further away with the SMH5-FM than I do with this Scala Rider G9x).  The reception, however, depends quite a bit on the routing of the speaker wires, and I might find myself getting better FM reception with this if I spend more time routing and/or re-routing the cable to the right speaker around in my helmet. Beyond the signal quality though the SMH5-FM had better - at least for my tastes - volume levels, which again leaves me thinking that perhaps I should have stuck with that device and not tried so hard to find nirvana in the motorcycle Bluetooth headset area.<br /><br />The control scheme (buttons) are not bad though it has been taking me a little while to get my fingers used to which buttons are which, especially when I have gloves on.  While these buttons are glove friendly, they're not exactly easy to distinguish even with obvious effort from the manufacturer (or their designers) to provide decent tactile response and controls.  You would likely find yourself feeling around a little to confirm whether you are hitting the A button, or the B button, or the center button, etc.  That problem area introduces another potential area of disappointment for me - the lack of a handlebar mounted remote control option (such as the type that is offered for some of the Sena models).<br /><br />I can use the smartphone app (which is another plus for this device), but that typically means either pulling over on the side of the road so I can tinker with the app, or doing something I'd consider a little stupid - mounting my smartphone on my motorcycle so I can attempt to use it while I'm riding.  Neither is really the right solution, at least not in my opinion.<br /><br />One more area of note for the FM radio options - the G9x offers only 6 presets for the radio station settings.  The SMH5-FM offered 10.  If you are lucky enough to live in an area with plenty of stations to choose from those extra presets can be handy and can again save you from having to pull out the phone and application so you can scan up or down the FM dial a bit.<br /><br />In the end, I like this device, but wish the manufacturer was more consumer friendly in their pricing and support for persons that purchase from, well, anywhere.  I wish it offered a handlebar remote control option, and I really wish it offered more volume and better tone preferences/options for users.  The positives for this device just don't make me want to move my rating higher.  (Though I suppose I could give this device another plus for the case that it comes with, which I would note I'm in agreement with some other comments that I've seen - the case is nice, but it will likely be put away quickly to collect dust once you get things configured and begin using the device regularly.)<br /><br />I may yet come back in the future and be posting a review"

302700,24106,"product gives me cold pricklies.<br /><br />Prior to using this software, I had previously (7 to 10 years ago) used a much-simpler landscape design software called \\""3D Landscape\\"" by the company 'Books That Work'. Since that product no longer existed, I was looking for another landscaping layout software tool (and did not need interior design features) that costed less than $100 and after doing some research, the two finalists that I was deciding between were this latest Punch Master Landscape Pro version 10.5.0 and the latest version of the Better Homes and Gardens \\""Designer\\"" software, which is built on top of a third-party CAD software from a company called Chief Architect. I ended up buying this for the main reason that it was $20 cheaper than the other product.<br /><br />If I was a professional landscape architect, I would definitely want to spend more for a professional CAD package instead of using this software because I find this product only adequate for casual doodling.<br /><br />ѾѾѾѾѾ Excellent 5-fuzzies feature ratings:<br /><br />ѾѾѾѾѾ This design software is totally loaded with tools and *potential*.  I refer to its many features as \\""potential\\"" because this software could have been so useful and powerful if it did not have all of the many bugs and problems mentioned below.<br /><br />ѾѾ Bad 2-fuzzies feature ratings:<br /><br />ѾѾ I have developed software for over 25 years now, and am very fluent in graphics design software. As the previous posters mentioned, this product is not for \\""the barely computer literate\\"" or those without patience. You need to read the printed User's Guide and tutorials built into the software. But having done that, I still found it fairly non-intuitive to start my design process. Unfortunately, much of the online and printed help is done piecemeal, lacks descriptions of which features depend on each other, and I ran into a number of false starts because the workflow that I wanted to use (of starting with an imported scanned topography diagram and scanned floor plan) required some dependencies that were not explained in the help documentation.<br /><br />ѾѾ I rate this software only 2 stars not because of lack of features, but because the software is very buggy. For example, I set a 5-degree slope from the house to the front street. Regardless of how I kept trying to get this to work, the front yard did not gradually slope down at a 5 degree angle, but instead sloped slightly for most of the span and then plunged downward right as it reached the front street. I then defined a 20-foot front driveway that should have also followed the same 5-degree slope and the software has an option to set the driveway to \\""Float Above Topography\\"", meaning that it should always be on top of the land. But, instead, a large jagged section inside of the driveway shows up as a hole; the front sidewalk also ended up with jagged holes in it. Punch has an online discussion forum, and someone had previously inquired about holes in their driveway/walkway, and the reply was to add more control points every 3 feet along the way, presumably to track the topography better. This did not fix my problem, even if I added a control point at 1-foot intervals. In defining my external walls, the software would frequently want to erratically connect the wrong two wall junctures together, resulting in having to delete the last wall segment that I drew and try again. Drawing inside walls also required the same wrestling with the software's bugs; sometimes after drawing a section of inside wall, the software would suddenly render a big hole in the floor, whereas if I tried to redraw it several mores times, trying to drag the line from a different direction, it worked.<br /><br />ѾѾ Adding plants to my design was easy, but I also encountered many bugs here. For example, there were two duplicate plants in the plant library with both named \\""Purple Smoke Tree\\"", but with conflicting plant details - one of the \\""Purple Smoke Tree\\"" entries was defined as having \\""Excessive\\"" water requirements, which is a totally wrong description of this drought-tolerant large shrub or small tree. The size requirements of various plants, especially the woody shrubs and trees also seems odd. Some shrubs get initially inserted as having a very unrealistic 12-foot diameter width at \\""0\\"" years age and then it just gets bigger from there if you change the years of aging. There are numerous inquiries on Punch's online discussion forums about resizing plants because the default sizings on plants were not realistic, and some of the replies were that the user should create their own graphic image with the desired scaling and import that into the software. Unfortunately, I found far too many plants in the software's plant library where the preset sizes and aged growth rates were extremely unrealistic, even if you lived in Hawaii or Florida and your plants grew like crazy. Another example: the pink shrub rose \\""Carefree"

Upon removing the cover it was discovered that its gasket had been installed with a kink which prevented a seal and caused the vacuum loss.

Not iTunes compatible.  Initial set-up and updating went well.  Took about 30 minutes total with network update.

364838,2529536,"unit gets louds, and at its loudest setting, 32, it does not distort. Music plays wirelessly; the phone docks to the unit for charging purposes only. The Bluetooth connection is very effortless; the speaker dock found and connected with my phone almost immediately.   So that's the good news. Now here is the bad news. Because the speaker dock has so few buttons or controls, you need an app to control the alarm clock function. Philips wants you to download its Fidelio app, but the app is pretty large, (it may be a resource hog on your phone) and buggy.   The instructions, which are very bare (just a series of drawings, no real written instructions) don't really tell you much, so you have to sort of feel your way around the app to figure things out. It took me a while to find the actual alarm function on the app, which is not good if you are half asleep trying to adjust the alarm. I would suggest downloading any of the free"

The color is more closely allied with light beige; at least the one that I received is darker and more brown than the picture led me to believe.  This matters to me because the ottoman was purchased to go with my cream colored sofa, so the match is not too good.  Nevertheless, at $29.99 with super saver shipping, this was an excellent deal.  Also, I don't especially think that the top has extra padding like the description said either; it seems more average than plush.

386124,1420393,"unit supplied yet - will report back on that. Videographers might note that there is an external mike that works with the hotshoe and uses no cables at all, nice!<br /><br />In general, I find the NX1000/1100 easy to use, the manual focus works well, the Smart mode seems to do fairly well, there are a great many scene modes and other (somewhat gimmicky) features (Magic filters/frames, etc.).  I enjoyed playing with those on the WB150F, but they seem out of place here.  There are a superb number of image adjustments, exposure tweaks, and  controls of a more serious nature as well. When you want to get serious, this camera is ready.  Also, some of  the fun things, like the Panorama mode, do work well if you understand their limitations and keep your expectations reasonable.<br /><br />As expected, the APS-C sensor renders a lot of good image detail. This is the big plus for this camera. I was very pleased with the results under good lighting conditions.  I shoot a lot of landscape and street stuff, and this camera seems well suited for that.  The noise reduction seems to work well up to about 1600 or so (maybe 800 for purists).  Colors are accurate and not over-saturated like on many consumer cameras.  If you like the \\""boost\\"" many cameras give by default, there is a \\""Vivid\\"" mode which will do this for you.  Personally, I prefer the more realistic colors (one of the things I like about Olympus and (most) Panasonics as well). Sharpness is good in JPEGs (I have not shot RAW yet) and tones are nice and smooth (think large expanses of blue sky and clouds).  I'm sure with experience my results will improve over these initial test shots, so that bodes well.  If you like to print big, 16x20, even 20x30 possibly, you will be able to do so, which is very nice.<br /><br />The 20-50mm kit lens is nice enough, but has a very limited range compared to what I am used to.  (I am considering getting the 30mm lens which I think would make a nice compact package for everyday use.)  However, the images look good, sharp, detailed, so I am happy with it.  Video worked well and the zoom worked fine in video mode and was silent.  In casual use, there is no need to switch the dial to video mode, you can just press the Video button on the back and after a slight pause you're in action.  This is nice.  Of course, dialing to full video mode gives you more options.<br /><br />Wifi features worked fine, I was able to easily connect and save pics using the autobackup mode.  Skydrive and others worked fine.  Have not tried the mobile link and remote view finder apps yet. (Update:  I tried these apps out and they worked OK for the most part.  A bit flaky at times.  There is a new \\""Smart Camera app\\"" to replace these, but it only works with the new firmware.  Since I have not yet upgraded the firmware, have not tried it.)  The PC_Autobackup mode works very well for transferring pics and movies to your PC.  It remembers what has been transferred and only transfers new items.  Best to transfer frequently, since slower than reading from a card, but all automatic and very convenient.  [You can also transfer photos to your mobile devices (phone/tablet) using the other apps (Mobile Link/Smart Camera).]<br /><br />Example: You get back from shooting, you activate the PC-Autobackup on the camera (your laptop/PC and network must be on, of course), and the camera will connect and begin transferring your content.  When done the camera will turn-off (unless you press a control button within 30 seconds) and you can set the PC to shutdown as well if you like.  Or you can select the \\""open folder\\"" choice on the PC/notenook popup dialog and view your pics and movies.  All very easy and convenient.<br /><br />There is a \\""Smart Range\\"" feature to extend  dynamic range and preserve highlights.  It seems to work well, but you lose shadow detail. Might want to turn off by default, I think.  (You can also shoot RAW and tweak things  yourself, of course.)<br /><br />JPEGS look very good to me with a lot of detail and sharpness.  So good that I think shooting JEPG only is feasible with the NX1000.  (You can always switch to RAW or RAW+Jpeg when needed, of course.)  I think many will find the Jpegs entirely adequate for most purposes.  (If you shoot a lot at high ISO's you would definitely want to shoot RAW.)  You have a range of aspect ratios including 1:1, 3:2, and 16:9.  This is nice and gives you flexibility in camera versus cropping later.<br /><br />The 8fps burst mode worked very well, though as has been noted everywhere, there is a lag as the camera processes the shots before you can shoot again.  I am a fairly deliberate photographer and don't shoot much action/sports, so the NX1000/1100 is fine for me.  The occasional lags when switching modes and after bursts or RAW shots are not an issue for me, but could be for some.  It's all covered in many of the excellent online review"

387542,872626,"unit provides a single 12V DC power port which can be used to run 12V fans or plug up car chargers for cell phones. But, it also provides two 120V AC wall outlets thanks to a (switchable on/off) built in power inverter. This let's you plug up regular items and run them off the battery pack. I expect, though, it would be more efficient to run a 12V fan from the accesory outlet than using a 120V AC fan since there is always energy lost when convertnig from a AC to DC.<br /><br />I have used the unit a few times, and it was able to run a small 12V fan all night long, and I have used it in a warehouse to bring temporary power to places we couldn't easily get extension cords to. It seems to do the trick just fine.<br /><br />There are some things I do not like. First, it is charged via a standard \\""wall wart\\"" adapter (1amp, 12V). The one that comes with it does not seem like a perfect fit, as the barrel connector sticks out (with exposed metal) from the power jack a bit. It also seems to be cheap, with a thin wire. On the plus, it is a standard type adapter, so you could get a replacement (1amp or greater) from RadioShack if needed.<br /><br />But, there is no place to keep the charger adapter. My old unit had a compartment on the back where you kept the AC adapter and a car 12V power cable. That would have been a nice touch for this unit, even if it made the case a bit larger. I just know I am going to go somewhere and forget the charger and not be able to use the unit.<br /><br />I e-mailed the company a few times before purchasing, and they say you should get about 300 charges before the battery is shot. They also claim the battery can be replaced, but the unit specifically says not to. (I expect you could just open it up with a screw driver, and find a standard 12V battery that could be swapped out.)<br /><br />To keep the battery in good health, they suggest charging it immediately after use, and charging it up every 30 days if it is not being used. Now I think I understand why my other unit just stopped working after sitting in storage for the past year or so.<br /><br />Unlike my last unit, this one can be left plugged in. The charging circuit will stop, and cycle, rather than overcharging. But, again, they warn that if you do this, you should disconnect it and put a load on it (run some device on it, using the battery) every 30 days to keep the battery healthy as long as possible.<br /><br />Another thing... Instructions say to charge the unit for 36 hours before first use. Also expect to let the thing recharge overnight (it seems to take longer than 8 hours).<br /><br />If they added a way to keep the recharger inside the unit (or, made it work like their other newer devices that let you use any extention cord to recharge), this would be nearly perfect. The only other thing I would like to see is a USB port (again, like their jumper cable boxes they sell at Walmart have).<br /><br />It seems this is just an old design. If they could revise it with some of those items, it would be close to perfect. As it stands, it seems very good, and has proven itself quite useful.<br /><br />The only question to me is: How long will the battery last before it no longer recharges? It is too soon to tell. If it fails, I will update this review"

No matter which version you get, you can easily install the competitor's eReader on it and get best of both worlds. So don't let that be a deciding factor in you purchase.<br /><br />The Planet is very inexpensive (especially if you can wait for sales in department stores), yet it advertises an impressive list of functions on paper: eBook reader, Android internet tablet, video camera, multimedia player, etc. But how does it perform in real life? Let's examine it in details:<br /><br />- As an eBook reader:<br />The Planet claims a 7\\"" color display, similar to the B&N [[ASIN:1400532655 NOOK Color]] and the Amazon [[ASIN:B0051VVOB2 Kindle Fire]]. However, it is important to note that the Planet's display (resolution 800x600) has an aspect ratio of 1.33 to 1, while the other two displays have wider aspect ratio of 1.7 to 1. So although they all have the same diagonal length of 7 inches, the Planet's screen is actually 10% larger in area! As an eReader, this larger area is a big advantage. On the other hand, the wider screens on Nook Color and Kindle Fire are better for viewing movies.<br /><br />In additional to the pre-installed eReader app, you can also install free"

393218,1630106,"unit gets louder and louder like a DC-10 jet taking off at the airport.  These filters are $21 dollars apiece at my local brick and mortar stores and are not easy to find (even in stores that sell the vacuum).  On line, I was able to buy a set of 3 for a low of $9.99 per filter + shipping.  Unless you want to spend a lot of money, you will be cleaning these things out frequently (pretty much after one to three uses).      With the filter clogged, the suction goes to pot and the noise level gets intolerable, so there's really no choice.  Mine may clog more often than most, given heavy use of the vacuum (I have small children) and rabbit hair...  If you're like me you will be cleaning the filter often--I use a child's medium bristle toothbrush.  On a suggestion from a reader of this review"

465715,1742445,"product gets really creamy. I find that my skin doesn't feel overly dry after using this scrub. In fact the dryness and peeling I was experiencing has magically disappeared. I live in a very dry region of Washington state and was desperate to find something that would solve the problem I was having with dry areas on my cheeks. This scrub has solved my problem and in only one week. So what is in this miracle working product? The ingredients include things like apricot seed powder, Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, papaya extract, calendula flower extract, lemon grass, horsetail, sea kelp, glycolic acid and natural fragrant oils. Truly this has the scent of lilies and is very pleasant. Using this is also an aromatic experience. Try this for a week and see what you think. I believe you will be pleased. And if you have oily skin you may notice a reduction in oil for some reason. I haven't figured out what is in this product that would cause that to happen but my skin is now more balanced. Maybe because I was using a cleanser before that dried my skin out too much. So gentle does it.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"

466675,1690876,"product offers a substantial benefit over my current gear.)    So as I said I own the Netgear AV200/\\""200 Mbit\\"" kit (XAV2001 I believe).  I have previously used Linksys 85Mbit adapters to effect, and we have wireless in the house, but the AV200's were good performers and worth the ~$100 I spent on them, and adequately replaced wireless where I had some serious dead spots in my house.  I dropped into Staples last night and lo and behold, they had the Netgear AV500 kit in their pretty red box for $139.  I decided to give it a go, figuring if my network performance was significantly better, I'd keep them.  If not, I'd return them, having kept the packaging perfect, and ensuring Staples would take them back if Netgear had BS'd the numbers.     My overall setup is rather nightmarish to describle so I'll detail just the following:  1.) The AV500's went exactly in the place of the two AV200's.  They are on separate ends of the house laterally , source onmain floor, destination on second floor  2.) Same exact Cat 5 and Cat 6 cables in the same exact place  3.) While I seriously doubt this had any impact, I substituted an 8 port Cisco 10/100 switch for an 8 port Netgear ProSage Gigabit switch.  (In theory I'm not touching the upper end capability of the Cisco switch so that's why I say it should not make a difference, but I point it out to not mislead.)    4.) Use:  The AV500s link an AV Closet in a \\""black hole\\"" of my house (the master bedroom) to a DLINK dual band Gigabit N-Router.  The overall feed is, from Source to Destination, [FiOS Modem > NetGear 24 port Gigabit Switch > DLINK Gigabit Router > Netgear AV500 Unit 1 (Source) > Netgear AV500 Unit 2 (AV Closet) > Netgear ProSafe Gigabit Switch > Components).    5.)  Components    a.) Windows 7 PC / media server with 4 TB of stored lossless music and MKV/MP4 videos  b.) Tivo Series 3 (x2)  c.) Xbox 360  d.) BR Player  e.) DLink Boxee (love this, 5 stars)    6.) AV200 vs AV500 - the beef    Prior to installing the AV200's 9 months ago, my network performance in the destination area of the house was dismal.  Averaging a series of speedtest.net runs where the only thing in the \\""component\\"" list above that was using the network was the PC, I was getting avg 400Kbit/sec on a system that had previosuly scored 40Mbit Down 35Mbit Up in \\""wireless hot spots\\"".  The ~40Mb down speed was proven on several Speedtest.net runs and I'd proven it out when I downloaded a 1.7 GB file in under 7 minutes via a swarm, over wireless (in a much better location in the house).    Download rates sustained for minutes at a time touched 4.3MegaByte per second.  I was thrilled.    Needless to say, when I saw the 90% drop in wireless performance in a critical area of the house, I knew I needed something better.  I had built an AV closet in a bad spot of the house (well, bad for network, else great for my purposes).      Installing the original Netgear AV200's, I saw speeds come back up to 2.2MegaByte per second.  Speedtest.net showed similar Mb numbers (16-20MBit Down, 10-13MBit Up.)      AV200's would have been ok but I was running into several problems.  Beyond the closet, there are Tivos downstairs which require that the Powerline adapters be the medium between my PC/Server upstairs.  PyTivo being the encoder, I saw a significant difference between \\""local\\"" xfers in the bedroom, and xfers from upstairs to the downstairs area.  Generally PyTivo could playback in realtime (initiate xfer, no wait, watch) on movies upto 720p.  1080 MKV containers took a little bit to get running, but overall, not bad.  1080 files xferred downstairs were a joke.  I had to initiate the xter WELL in advance of watching it.      SO...what do the AV500's do?  Get this.  Last night, first test - shut down all components except the PC.  Begin download of a very popular show which should present the full challenge to the AV500's.  Sustained speed download?  5.2MegaByte a second.  I was very surprised.  I would have kept these units if they'd come within 80% of my original wireless 4.2-4.4MB/sec.  But to exceed their performance, simply floored me.  I had pretty modest expectations that AV500s would defeat the AV200s.  I was wrong.  And I do love when I'm wrong and it benefits me.      My 0.02 are that if my review"

I really like the teardrop shape, and the cats took to the fountain with no issues. I like that they can drink from the fountain or from the relatively-still \\""pool\\"" that collects to the side. Best of all, while the unit isn't noiseless, it's definitely the quietest drinking fountain we've owned -- there's very little electronic hum, and it's largely drowned out by the normal splashing fountain sounds. I also like that the unit is super easy to dissemble and clean -- I can clean this fountain by myself in five minutes flat, with no snapping parts to wrestle into place. The only potential downside that I can see is that a really energetic dog or kitten might be able to shift the parts, but my cats are quiet senior adults and don't try to play in the fountain. I will also note that I like the shiny silver surface, but it seems to be losing a lot of luster in the short time since we've had it. So it's not perfect, but it meets our needs.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardolln the kitchen, I realized I could hear it humming from the bedroom.

541447,355105,"unit supplied yet - will report back on that. Videographers might note that there is an external mike that works with the hotshoe and uses no cables at all, nice!<br /><br />In general, I find the NX1000/1100 easy to use, the manual focus works well, the Smart mode seems to do fairly well, there are a great many scene modes and other (somewhat gimmicky) features (Magic filters/frames, etc.).  I enjoyed playing with those on the WB150F, but they seem out of place here.  There are a superb number of image adjustments, exposure tweaks, and  controls of a more serious nature as well. When you want to get serious, this camera is ready.  Also, some of  the fun things, like the Panorama mode, do work well if you understand their limitations and keep your expectations reasonable.<br /><br />As expected, the APS-C sensor renders a lot of good image detail. This is the big plus for this camera. I was very pleased with the results under good lighting conditions.  I shoot a lot of landscape and street stuff, and this camera seems well suited for that.  The noise reduction seems to work well up to about 1600 or so (maybe 800 for purists).  Colors are accurate and not over-saturated like on many consumer cameras.  If you like the \\""boost\\"" many cameras give by default, there is a \\""Vivid\\"" mode which will do this for you.  Personally, I prefer the more realistic colors (one of the things I like about Olympus and (most) Panasonics as well). Sharpness is good in JPEGs (I have not shot RAW yet) and tones are nice and smooth (think large expanses of blue sky and clouds).  I'm sure with experience my results will improve over these initial test shots, so that bodes well.  If you like to print big, 16x20, even 20x30 possibly, you will be able to do so, which is very nice.<br /><br />The 20-50mm kit lens is nice enough, but has a very limited range compared to what I am used to.  (I am considering getting the 30mm lens which I think would make a nice compact package for everyday use.)  However, the images look good, sharp, detailed, so I am happy with it.  Video worked well and the zoom worked fine in video mode and was silent.  In casual use, there is no need to switch the dial to video mode, you can just press the Video button on the back and after a slight pause you're in action.  This is nice.  Of course, dialing to full video mode gives you more options.<br /><br />Wifi features worked fine, I was able to easily connect and save pics using the autobackup mode.  Skydrive and others worked fine.  Have not tried the mobile link and remote view finder apps yet. (Update:  I tried these apps out and they worked OK for the most part.  A bit flaky at times.  There is a new \\""Smart Camera app\\"" to replace these, but it only works with the new firmware.  Since I have not yet upgraded the firmware, have not tried it.)  The PC_Autobackup mode works very well for transferring pics and movies to your PC.  It remembers what has been transferred and only transfers new items.  Best to transfer frequently, since slower than reading from a card, but all automatic and very convenient.  [You can also transfer photos to your mobile devices (phone/tablet) using the other apps (Mobile Link/Smart Camera).]<br /><br />Example: You get back from shooting, you activate the PC-Autobackup on the camera (your laptop/PC and network must be on, of course), and the camera will connect and begin transferring your content.  When done the camera will turn-off (unless you press a control button within 30 seconds) and you can set the PC to shutdown as well if you like.  Or you can select the \\""open folder\\"" choice on the PC/notenook popup dialog and view your pics and movies.  All very easy and convenient.<br /><br />There is a \\""Smart Range\\"" feature to extend  dynamic range and preserve highlights.  It seems to work well, but you lose shadow detail. Might want to turn off by default, I think.  (You can also shoot RAW and tweak things  yourself, of course.)<br /><br />JPEGS look very good to me with a lot of detail and sharpness.  So good that I think shooting JEPG only is feasible with the NX1000.  (You can always switch to RAW or RAW+Jpeg when needed, of course.)  I think many will find the Jpegs entirely adequate for most purposes.  (If you shoot a lot at high ISO's you would definitely want to shoot RAW.)  You have a range of aspect ratios including 1:1, 3:2, and 16:9.  This is nice and gives you flexibility in camera versus cropping later.<br /><br />The 8fps burst mode worked very well, though as has been noted everywhere, there isa lag as the camera processes the shots before you can shoot again.  I am a fairly deliberate photographer and don't shoot much action/sports, so the NX1000/1100 is fine for me.  The occasional lags when switching modes and after bursts or RAW shots are not an issue for me, but could be for some.  It's all covered in many of the excellent online review"

546064,541189,"unit is getting useful.  Decided to try multiple schedules next, which would make the unit very valuable.  The schedules sort of work, but there are a few problems. The biggest one is that the online website sensicomfort.com, and the smartphone access each have their own separate multiple schedules flag, so if you set it on one, the other will not update to reflect the information. Another major issue is that none of the schedule information seems to be available on the thermostat itself.  I would hope the developers were not so stupid as to be running the schedules on a website and downloading setpoints to the thermostat as they go.  If they are the company is eventually going to be bankrupt because that means you have to have wireless access in your home and internet access 24/7 to use it as a programmable thermostat.  That's like having an alarm system that only works if the house has power and an internet connection. If the connection was lost the thermostat would just keep using the last setpoint downloaded. The safe (and correct) way to implement a schedule would be to download the entire schedule into the thermostat and activate it. Will be testing"
546097,2668228,"unit got bashed during a personal move and IOGear offered to service it up to three years later, while asking few questions about how it got damaged.

However, it chokes the speed down to USB 1.1, which is hardly forgiveable with USB3 just around the corner.     IOGear (and many other manuafucturers) have neglected the realities of the enthusiast niche of this market by leaving an important feature severely constrained by slow speeds. USB flashdrives and portable hard disk drives that are plugged into my monitors' USB ports work noticeably slower when this KVM switch is wired into the loop. This product needs an update to improve USB performance.     For USB 2.0 performance I have an Avocent SwitchviewDVI that I have used for 6 months for monitor switching using the front buttons (that function works well). Unfortunately, I have yet to connect anything USB to it, nor test any other functions of the Avocent. So I can't say whether the USB switching works well, or whether it performs at USB 2.0 speeds (as advertised). Hopefully, I will get some experience with the Avocent by next year and post a review"

On the down side it's performance is marginal.     I wasn't interested in, and have not tested, the built in mic. I wanted a way to wirelessly connect headphones to my bluetooth enabled laptop. I was able to establish the link without difficulty; however, I was disappointed to find that instead of the advertised 10m/33ft of range I get more like 7 or 8 feet of line of site range (vs 25 or so feet w/ a [[ASIN:B001IKJSRC Jawbone headset]] on the same laptop).

I recommend investing in this cheaper model first to see if it works for you, and then upgrading to the bells and whistles later if you really love it.

563197,3295169,unit gets hot when charging.  No to happy with this.<br /><br />Fantastic camera that takes good quality photos from either front or rear.  Otherwords both sides.  It has a photo editing program that I found fun and does a nice job with playing around getting just what you want for a photo.  There is also a draw program that is quite fun and very useful to those of us that do photos and graphics.<br /><br />Screen display is really nice and when I went online the google browser is great.  Fast google searching makes for a happy camper.  I absolutely love the size of this tablet.  I find it lighter and much easier to handle that even the 8&#34; model and there really isn't that much difference in size but there is in weight.  If you have problems with your hands or wrists this would be the better size to handle.<br /><br />Turing the unit on takes a very moments and is not as fast as other brands.  I have played with three other brand names and have found this one to be the slowest upstart.  Not a real big issue though unless you are impatient.<br /><br />Now for the cream of the review

567974,3472630,"unit supplied yet - will report back on that. Videographers might note that there is an external mike that works with the hotshoe and uses no cables at all, nice!<br /><br />In general, I find the NX1000/1100 easy to use, the manual focus works well, the Smart mode seems to do fairly well, there are a great many scene modes and other (somewhat gimmicky) features (Magic filters/frames, etc.).  I enjoyed playing with those on the WB150F, but they seem out of place here.  There are a superb number of image adjustments, exposure tweaks, and  controls of a more serious nature as well. When you want to get serious, this camera is ready.  Also, some of  the fun things, like the Panorama mode, do work well if you understand their limitations and keep your expectations reasonable.<br /><br />As expected, the APS-C sensor renders a lot of good image detail. This is the big plus for this camera. I was very pleased with the results under good lighting conditions.  I shoot a lot of landscape and street stuff, and this camera seems well suited for that.  The noise reduction seems to work well up to about 1600 or so (maybe 800 for purists).  Colors are accurate and not over-saturated like on many consumer cameras.  If you like the \\""boost\\"" many cameras give by default, there is a \\""Vivid\\"" mode which will do this for you.  Personally, I prefer the more realistic colors (one of the things I like about Olympus and (most) Panasonics as well). Sharpness is good in JPEGs (I have not shot RAW yet) and tones are nice and smooth (think large expanses of blue sky and clouds).  I'm sure with experience my results will improve over these initial test shots, so that bodes well.  If you like to print big, 16x20, even 20x30 possibly, you will be able to do so, which is very nice.<br /><br />The 20-50mm kit lens is nice enough, but has a very limited range compared to what I am used to.  (I am considering getting the 30mm lens which I think would make a nice compact package for everyday use.)  However, the images look good, sharp, detailed, so I am happy with it.  Video worked well and the zoom worked fine in video mode and was silent.  In casual use, there is no need to switch the dial to video mode, you can just press the Video button on the back and after a slight pause you're in action.  This is nice.  Of course, dialing to full video mode gives you more options.<br /><br />Wifi features worked fine, I was able to easily connect and save pics using the autobackup mode.  Skydrive and others worked fine.  Have not tried the mobile link and remote view finder apps yet. (Update:  I tried these apps out and they worked OK for the most part.  A bit flaky at times.  There is a new \\""Smart Camera app\\"" to replace these, but it only works with the new firmware.  Since I have not yet upgraded the firmware, have not tried it.)  The PC_Autobackup mode works very well for transferring pics and movies to your PC.  It remembers what has been transferred and only transfers new items.  Best to transfer frequently, since slower than reading from a card, but all automatic and very convenient.  [You can also transfer photos to your mobile devices (phone/tablet) using the other apps (Mobile Link/Smart Camera).]<br /><br />Example: You get back from shooting, you activate the PC-Autobackup on the camera (your laptop/PC and network must be on, of course), and the camera will connect and begin transferring your content.  When done the camera will turn-off (unless you press a control button within 30 seconds) and you can set the PC to shutdown as well if you like.  Or you can select the \\""open folder\\"" choice on the PC/notenook popup dialog and view your pics and movies.  All very easy and convenient.<br /><br />There is a \\""Smart Range\\"" feature to extend  dynamic range and preserve highlights.  It seems to work well, but you lose shadow detail. Might want to turn off by default, I think.  (You can also shoot RAW and tweak things  yourself, of course.)<br /><br />JPEGS look very good to me with a lot of detail and sharpness.  So good that I think shooting JEPG only is feasible with the NX1000.  (You can always switch to RAW or RAW+Jpeg when needed, of course.)  I think many will find the Jpegs entirely adequate for most purposes.  (If you shoot a lot at high ISO's you would definitely want to shoot RAW.)  You have a range of aspect ratios including 1:1, 3:2, and 16:9.  This is nice and gives you flexibility in camera versus cropping later.<br /><br />The 8fps burst mode worked very well, though as has been noted everywhere, there is a lag as the camera processes the shots before you can shoot again.  I am a fairly deliberate photographer and don't shoot much action/sports, so the NX1000/1100 is fine for me.  The occasional lags when switching modes and after bursts or RAW shotsare not an issue for me, but could be for some.  It's all covered in many of the excellent online review"

If you like to turn up the volume, you might want to keep this in mind when you're listening to them at the office or on an airplane.  The case is one of the nicest I've seen included with a pair of headphones.  Even companies like Sennheiser, typically only include a pouch, if that, with their headphones.  Since the EMBRACE fold flat, they slide easily into the case.  The outside is made out of a black faux leather and the inside is lined with blue felt.  The fastener is magnetic, which can be a little cumbersome to use, but hopefully your EMBRACE will spend more time on your head than in the case.  Even though the EMBRACE feel like $200 headphones, they'd probably do better at $150 or $175.  There are a lot of competitors in the $200 and over range.  At $150, the EMBRACE would undercut competitors while providing a better value.     SPECS  Frequency Range: 20 Hz to 20 kHz  Sensitivity: 103 dB SPL at 1kHz  Impedance: 24 ohms  Max Power: 15mW  Driver Diameter: 40mm  Warranty: 1 Year  CONCLUSION  BlueAnt Wireless has a winner with the EMBRACE stereo headphones.  Beautifully styled, the EMBRACE matches its good looks with good sound quality.  The EMBRACE has features and accessories found normally in high-end headphones because the fact is, the EMBRACE are high-end headphones--and darn good ones too.  I highly recommend them for use with iPhones, iPods, laptops and other portable multimedia devices.  * Review"

I did have to make adjustments from 3/4\\"" supply lines down to the 1/2\\"" necessary for this unit; the downsized pipe acts as a self-restrictor of sorts, slowing down the water flow to allow ample heating of the water before it exits the heater.<br /><br />I also installed an inline scale inhibitor filter, Aqua-Pur AP430SS, so reconfiguring the plumbing was necessary, as well as the addition of two 1/4-turn ball valves.

I should note that this Sony does offer many more features than the Denon model I am comparing it to, such as lighting control, four Ethernet ports, and a plethora of various connection options.  Plus, of course, it is more powerful and offers a 9.2 connection setup.  However, considering that this a higher-end model, for the price it is being offered it should do all of the things the much cheaper Denon does and more.<br /><br />I will also, once more, emphasize the quality of the sound from this Sony unit.  When playing movies, watching television, or listening to music, the difference was readily apparent.  In fact, I don't see how it can get much better....if you're looking for a wow factor, you'll find it here.  If Sony would just learn from Denon regarding GUI, they would have a definite home run here.<br /><br />I hope this review"

642036,389680,"unit provided by LED Lenserwas parked, which I'd estimate at about 150-200 feet.  Keep in mind that the P5 is a single-mode flashlight. There are no colored LEDs, strobes, or low-power modes. The runtime on the P5 with a AA battery is 2 hours, which is about on par with other high-powered flashlights at similar lumen. I inserted a freshly charged Sanyo Eneloop AA battery (1.2v) and didn't notice any major degradation in performance, when compared with the included alkaline battery (1.5v).  ACCESSORIES  The P5 comes with a nice nylon sheath that can be strapped onto a belt or clipped on with the attached carabiner. The sheath has velcro and a button to safely keep it attached to your belt but can be removed easily without having to remove your belt.  Also included with the P5 is a lanyard that can be attached to the ring on the tail cap of the P5. The sheath has a slot to feed the lanyard through so you can use the lanyard with the sheath.  CONCLUSION  The LED Lenser P5 is one amazingly bright flashlight. It might hold a slight price premium over similarly-rated flashlights, but the quality of the light over the entire range of focus and the ingenious focus mechanism make the P5 worthy of your consideration. It is the brightest and easiest to use flashlight in my growing arsenal of flashlights that include lights from Fenix, Inova, Smith & Wesson, Maglite, and various generics.  * Review"

645033,3399583,"unit offers are truly amazing. Run it on 3-AAA batteries, or charge the internal Lithium-Ion battery via USB, solar, or crank-power! The crank handle locks firmly out of the way in a recess on the front of the unit. Cranking is firm but not overly difficult, but your arm will feel it after a few minutes and I found myself switching arms often. The crank grip is round and made of deeply knurled plastic which feels abrasive to your fingers after several minutes of continuous cranking - the smooth flat grip I've used on other hand-crank generators would be a better design, in my opinion. I imagine I will be using the solar and USB charging functions a lot more often than the crank, but in a truly devastating disaster (think nuclear war or accident), then I would be grateful for the crank if we didn't have access to direct sunlight.<br /><br />The owners manual supplied with the FRX5 is tiny (very small font), and overly brief with only (9), 5.5\\"" x 3\\"" pages of actual instructional information (excluding the safety, warranty and troubleshooting sections). The problem with this is most of the advanced features on this unit like setting the time, alarm clock, and the multitude of different weather alert features, requires 5 to 17 distinct steps using multiple controls on the unit. Since it is absolutely necessary to frequently consult the manual to get the most out of your device, I would have thought Eton would make it a bit more user friendly.<br /><br />For example, one glaring oversight in the manual is it doesn't instruct you to turn the unit on before performing any of the charging functions. I initially tried for several days to charge the unit in sunlight and couldn't figure out why it was stuck at 2/3 full charge. I just happened upon the solution when I was listening to the radio while trying yet again to solar charge the unit, and noticed the charging indicator had started moving!<br /><br />Hopefully Eton will listen to our feedback"

662675,2786267,"unit gives you a power port for a 3.5mm AUX input (adapter included). This is where the USB port exists for charging and the built-in 6,000mAh battery. This gives you up to eight hours of music, but if you play the Sound Blaster loudly, you will use the power up more quickly. Also, 6,000mAh alone will charge an average Smartphone about 2.5-3 times, so plug it in while charging your smartphone. There is also a small Play/Pause and Forward/Back buttons for songs along with a Record button and a microphone mute for sound recording. Did I mention the Loud Sounds switch, the Alarm arming switch or the Alarm button? It really is a welcome assortment of overkill.<br /><br />If you are going to spend the money for the Sound Blaster Roar, you will get your money's worth. The amount of functions and the audio performance are so well designed and constructed, I don't think anything else is out there that comes close. I am really impressed with this device. It's about time a company designed and produced a great multi-function Bluetooth speaker system that is actually affordable and worth every penny!<br /><br />Product supplied for a fair and honest review"

695095,332108,"unit supplied yet - will report back on that. Videographers might note that there is an external mike that works with the hotshoe and uses no cables at all, nice!<br /><br />In general, I find the NX1000/1100 easy to use, the manual focus works well, the Smart mode seems to do fairly well, there are a greatmany scene modes and other (somewhat gimmicky) features (Magic filters/frames, etc.).  I enjoyed playing with those on the WB150F, but they seem out of place here.  There are a superb number of image adjustments, exposure tweaks, and  controls of a more serious nature as well. When you want to get serious, this camera is ready.  Also, some of  the fun things, like the Panorama mode, do work well if you understand their limitations and keep your expectations reasonable.<br /><br />As expected, the APS-C sensor renders a lot of good image detail. This is the big plus for this camera. I was very pleased with the results under good lighting conditions.  I shoot a lot of landscape and street stuff, and this camera seems well suited for that.  The noise reduction seems to work well up to about 1600 or so (maybe 800 for purists).  Colors are accurate and not over-saturated like on many consumer cameras.  If you like the \\""boost\\"" many cameras give by default, there is a \\""Vivid\\"" mode which will do this for you.  Personally, I prefer the more realistic colors (one of the things I like about Olympus and (most) Panasonics as well). Sharpness is good in JPEGs (I have not shot RAW yet) and tones are nice and smooth (think large expanses of blue sky and clouds).  I'm sure with experience my results will improve over these initial test shots, so that bodes well.  If you like to print big, 16x20, even 20x30 possibly, you will be able to do so, which is very nice.<br /><br />The 20-50mm kit lens is nice enough, but has a very limited range compared to what I am used to.  (I am considering getting the 30mm lens which I think would make a nice compact package for everyday use.)  However, the images look good, sharp, detailed, so I am happy with it.  Video worked well and the zoom worked fine in video mode and was silent.  In casual use, there is no need to switch the dial to video mode, you can just press the Video button on the back and after a slight pause you're in action.  This is nice.  Of course, dialing to full video mode gives you more options.<br /><br />Wifi features worked fine, I was able to easily connect and save pics using the autobackup mode.  Skydrive and others worked fine.  Have not tried the mobile link and remote view finder apps yet. (Update:  I tried these apps out and they worked OK for the most part.  A bit flaky at times.  There is a new \\""Smart Camera app\\"" to replace these, but it only works with the new firmware.  Since I have not yet upgraded the firmware, have not tried it.)  The PC_Autobackup mode works very well for transferring pics and movies to your PC.  It remembers what has been transferred and only transfers new items.  Best to transfer frequently, since slower than reading from a card, but all automatic and very convenient.  [You can also transfer photos to your mobile devices (phone/tablet) using the other apps (Mobile Link/Smart Camera).]<br /><br />Example: You get back from shooting, you activate the PC-Autobackup on the camera (your laptop/PC and network must be on, of course), and the camera will connect and begin transferring your content.  When done the camera will turn-off (unless you press a control button within 30 seconds) and you can set the PC to shutdown as well if you like.  Or you can select the \\""open folder\\"" choice on the PC/notenook popup dialog and view your pics and movies.  All very easy and convenient.<br /><br />There is a \\""Smart Range\\"" feature to extend  dynamic range and preserve highlights.  It seems to work well, but you lose shadow detail. Might want to turn off by default, I think.  (You can also shoot RAW and tweak things  yourself, of course.)<br /><br />JPEGS look very good to me with a lot of detail and sharpness.  So good that I think shooting JEPG only is feasible with the NX1000.  (You can always switch to RAW or RAW+Jpeg when needed, of course.)  I think many will find the Jpegs entirely adequate for most purposes.  (If you shoot a lot at high ISO's you would definitely want to shoot RAW.)  You have a range of aspect ratios including 1:1, 3:2, and 16:9.  This is nice and gives you flexibility in camera versus cropping later.<br /><br />The 8fps burst mode worked very well, though as has been noted everywhere, there is a lag as the camera processes the shots before you can shoot again.  I am a fairly deliberate photographer and don't shoot much action/sports, so the NX1000/1100 is fine for me.  The occasional lags when switching modes and after bursts or RAW shots are not an issue for me, but could be for some.  It's all covered in many of the excellent online review"

750104,742562,"product offering, but bottom line, since the Google Market is there, I simply downloaded the top-of-the-line keyboard and email programs that I wanted...  For less than $10 my problem was solved -- no need to get geeky and start flashing ROMs, downloading new OS'es, and risk \\""bricking\\"" your tablet.   CONs:   - I wish I could adjust the two HOME DOCK items on the right side of the center Home screen -- these are preset to open the pre-installed browser and email programs, rather than the ones I downloaded.     - The pre-installed browser and keyboard tend to go to a full blank page when you have to enter info into a box on a webpage -- this obviously doesn't work as expected.  After I installed a new keyboard I wanted anyway, this seemed to solve the problem for me.  Updating to a top-notch browser might also do the trick.    - I do wish I could customize a few things more, such as setting the volume for each notification type separately.  Currently, there are just 2 volume settings, and new email notifications play thru the tablet speakers even when headphones are plugged in -- I can understand the reasoning, but it still feels odd.       These are the only reasons for not giving 5 stars.  BTW, I read a lot of comments in the review"

763919,1528845,"unit gives a visual indication that the bell is being rung by means of a flashing light.<br /><br />The plug in chime unit is more compact than many I have seen - it measures 3 x 3.5 inches, roughly 7.5 x 8.5 cms. Like most plug in units, some clearance is needed below the chime for it to fit the socket correctly. I measured this as being 1.5 inches or roughly 5 cms.<br />The doorpush unit measures 1.75 inches by 3 inches, making it a little wider than the conventionally shaped bell-pushes, a point to note if it is being positioned on a narrow door frame. It doesn't have a name plate which some may require, although there is enough space for a name to be affixed.<br /><br />Screws are supplied for a permanent mounting of the bell push, but also a 3M double - sided sticky pad. A thin narrow blade such as a small screwdriver is needed to lever the bell-push apart and remove the plastic tab that protects the 12v, 23amp battery (this small cylinder battery is often used in cameras and is widely available to buy). The pad is specially shaped for this bell push and is a perfect fit, no need to trim it.<br /><br />There are controls on the side of the chime unit so that the the chime can be adjusted for volume, there is a choice of 48 tones available - some musical, others more conventional, I chose the straightforward Westminster chime. When the chime is sounding the blue light on the front of the unit activates, giving a visual indication that the bell is being rung.<br /><br />This makes it an ideal choice for a noisy household or for someone with impaired hearing. Before installation I took the bell - push outside and away from the house, it still activated well over 50 metres away. The guidance is that the signal is active up to 200 metres away.<br />Stylish, attractive and works well - it really is a good choice. I received this to review"

However, if you just speak briefly to your passenger, the music comes back on as soon as you click off with the passenger.  Also, music over bluetooth will only work with one or the other headset.  Your MP3 can't drive both headsets via bluetooth.  I mention this, because a lot of folks don't realize this.

Or you can deactivate VOX, and press the side button to connect, then press again when you're done.    We use these with our half helmets.  I wear hearing aids, and half helmets are the only helmet I can use my hearing aids with.  I sometimes ride with only 1 hearing aid.  Either way, with one or both hearing aid in, there is ample volume below about 65 mphto hear fine.  Over about 65 mph, the microphone picks up too much wind noise to work well.  Couple that with the wind rushing in to a half helmet, and it's only that much harder to hear.  Before you buy this for half helmets, read some review"

I am running a reasonably power hungry computer, (850w PSU, water cooled, EVGA GTX 680, Quad Core) a 27\\"" display, a 2ch + sub audio system and a desk lamp off of the SMT750. When my computer is sitting at the desktop, the entire aforementioned system only draws 145 watts. This is thanks to a high-effeciency power supply and energy smart monitor. If I was gaming or stressing my system that number would surely increase, but this is not the unit you buy if your desire is to play videogames for an hour while the power is out. I get a solid 20 minutes of backup power from this unit while doing intensive graphic work (the kind of thing i'd want to save if the power went out!) which is more than enough time to finish up what i'm doing, save everything, and shutdown. If I close out of my editing software and reduce the draw down to the 145 watts my system draws when idling I can get 40 minutes of full operation from this unit, and when you see numbers like that you start to understand why going with a higher wattage unit for a desktop is overkill.<br /><br />Higher wattage units require larger and more expensive batteries. 700 watts or greater might sound nice on paper but do you really want to pay a premium price for a replacement battery if you're only using a fraction of that?<br /><br />The best advice I can give is to go to Walmart and get a simple energy consumption meter to see how much the equipment you want to put on backup power actaully draws, and use that to decide which unit you need.<br /><br />I hope this review"

I am Mac user and the product works well when configuring it with a Mac.  The integration with the program guide with Directv is great  I offer up a few criticisms below and suggestions for Logitech:    1) I could not get my Link to communicate with my Mac I initially and it took posting a question to the Logitech forums asking for help to realize my dumb error - though I'm betting I'm not the only experienced Harmony remote programmer who's made this error - you HAVE to use [...] to program this device, NOT the standard Harmony configuration software.  Th good news is that once I started that,it worked great and I'd have to say the the interface on their web app is a bit better than their traditional application.  Since the  initial setup, I've gone back into their web app a few times to make some adjustments to my configuration.     2) the LINK only supports 8 devices.  That includes any console systems, pre-amps, DVD players, sat/cable boxes, etc.  this is a bit of an issue for me because in my theater I have 11 devices.  I couldn't get around this issue so I have excluded my PS3, my OPPO DVD player (which is primarily used for DVD-audio and SACD disks), and my external HDMI switch.  This isn't a show stopper because those particular devices (PS3 and OPPO) share the same HDMI input on my Onkyp pre-amp as my Apple TV.... S for those few times I need either of those, I'll get my lazy butt off my couch and adjust the cables myself.  I do think that Logitech should consider having this LINK support more devices - that is what kept this from being a 5 star review"

We try to be careful not to push the toaster all the way against the backsplash...but you know how it is with stuff that lives on the kitchen counter. It's always getting shoved back toward that wall, even if by accident.

The seat and seat back, while vented, are of hard plastic and may not be comfortable longer than several minutes.  Be ready to possibly buy a gel cushion or another seat.  The issue with the price is minor in that I find it is misleading (not per Amazon, but manufacturer).  The manufacturer does not show a list price on their website, but there is a list price shown of $699 on the Bowflex catalog website ( just like here) with a sale price of $399.  Personally I believe this to be misleading since  both Schwinn and Bowflex are of the same company, Nautilus.

834378,168828,"unit offered expandable internal storage capacity though, since I need to have an external drive on top of the stereo cabinet as well to accommodate all of my media (roughly 1.3 TB.)<br /><br />The remote is pretty good. Ergonomically designed, no buttons out of place, important buttons are big and easy to find, and a lot of playback options. I especially liked the audio lip sync function; I do wish that it had independent volume control though. The IR sensor on the unit is very responsive.<br /><br />The WD TV Live Hub has some flaws worth noting. Every few weeks, the device seems to get sluggish, and it resets itself several times before finally becoming usable again. The whole process takes about 5 minutes, which is annoying. When this happens, the device also sometimes drops your saved network credentials, as well as login information for Internet services like Netflix. This is pretty aggravating. I also noticed that firmware updates tend to wipeout your credentials as well. I'm thinking I won't install anymore of these unless it's for a really good reason.<br /><br />I also noticed a problem with slow UI performance when syncing an external drive larger than 1TB. Because of this, I dug up an old WD 750GB external desktop drive, and used this to augment the unit's internal storage. The UI and file manager work much better after making the switch. I've noticed that the external drive will stay powered on even when the TV Live Hub is off; so when I'm not using it, I eject it and unplug it from the hub. I should also mention that this unit CANNOT power a portable HD via USB, you need to use an external drive with its own power supply (AC adapter or the like.) I found this out the hard way, so be warned.<br /><br />The \\""media library\\"" function, which purportedly scans and organizes your media, does not work with my media collection, in fact it causes the whole system to lock up when enabled. I finally just disabled it, and now access files through the directory tree. The main menu is also clunky and a little four square for a device like this, but the way I have it set up it works well enough most of the time, except right before it decides to reset.<br /><br />Overall, this product meets expectations.

But come on, Magellan needs to support the Mac.    2.  Uses AA batteries instead of a rechargeable battery.  This may be a pro or con for you, depending on your preferences, but I strongly prefer a built-in, rechargeable battery.  The benefit is that if you carry spare AA batteries with you, then you are always ready.  But I prefer to simply charge up my device ahead of time and never have to buy batteries -- batteries are expensive!  My Garmin devices all use rechargeable batteries, and this is what I am used to.  Using AA batteries is so 20th century.    3.  Usability issues.  Overall, I liked the user interface, but it seems to need just a bit more usability testing"

841441,1700488,"unit gives are also clear, well-timed, and easily heard while driving.<br /><br />Most important to me, the unit is very easy to use.  You can easily find a direction by entering a city name or zip code, and then narrowing down to the street and exact address by touching the keyboard screen which is very responsive to touch.  You have a choice of shortest distance, fastest time, or greatest use of interstate to get you there.  Based on my experience, the unit provides efficient routing (and in some cases, fast routes I would have not have thought of to familiar destinations).  The unit seems to acquire satellites very quickly - in less than a minute compared to 3-4 minutes my Garmin sometimes takes.<br /><br />I have primarily used the unit to get to a specific address (200 Jones Street) rather than to find a location based on name (e.g., IHOP) and have had no problem with the unit getting me to an address.  The few times (10 or so) I have given name of a location (primarily restaurants), the unit has found them and gotten me there quickly.  A problem with the unit (unless I am missing something) is that it doesn't look as though you can update the software -- the manual is not terribly clear and the support site really isn't very helpful.<br /><br />I would say this is a good GPS unit that will meet the needs of many users.  In some ways, I think choosing a GPS unit is a matter of taste in terms of what features it has, so that it is probably best to read review"

845166,3425948,"unit gets a 5/5 rating - with the caveat that you have to understand that you are locked into paying them eternally for its usage. So think of it as a NetFlix account, where you keep paying each month (or each year) to get continued access to the system.<br /><br />UPDATE AFTER ONE WEEK:<br /><br />The unit has held up nicely, including going into a sauna. It is so lightweight that even while golfing it is completely unnoticeable (which is of course important). It gets great kudos for doing its job in a very unobtrusive manner. Compared against a variety of pedometers and other tracking devices it is accurate.<br /><br />The website's nutrition area was useful and easy to use. Updating and maintaining daily menus was simple. Having the stats there helped motivate more healthy eating. One downside is that the stats for a given day show you red and green as a simple color of reaching or not reaching a goal. So for example if my goal was to eat 40% of my daily intake as protein, it would calculate that to grams and then show me red all day long for protein until I crossed that level. I get no indicator if I'm close or far from my goal - I.e. should I eat a lot of protein at lunch or just a little. A bar graph would be much more helpful, to glance at and know what my remaining meals should look like.<br /><br />The website's exercise area does its job. You tell the system what types of exercises you enjoy, and they let you know what you'd need to do in each to reach your calorie goals. Their options are a wide range of activities from walking the dog to canoeing to gym equipment. So whatever it is you enjoy, the system will offer ideas with that in mind.<br /><br />We were a bit disappointed on day week-plus-one. The system had kept saying it would revamp our goals and assign us an \\""animal symbol\\"" once we got through the initial evaluation"

The unit spins really fast - but no fears -- there is a nonslip base that offers added stability when the spinner is spinning.  I do hold on to the spinner just in case, but so far, so good.<br /><br />There is a locking mechanism that keeps the handle locked for storing, along with a push button brake that stops the spinning with just one push.

886651,1806387,"product gets from YOU may vary from my rating, and I’ll explain why. This particular moisturizer is water-based, rather than oil-based.  What does this mean? It means that it will absorb quickly, won’t leave a “film” on your face or make you feel greasy, and is not sticky.  Those are the pros. Basically it’s a great moisturizer for people who don’t need THAT much moisturizing.  If you have very dry skin, this product won’t be enough for you.  But if you have oily or combination skin, this product will be great.  My skin tends to be dry, so for the winter, this product doesn’t replenish my skin well enough, however it’s fine for the summer when my skin tends to be more oily. The product itself is a pretty pale blue color and is a gel format, easy to spread on. It does have a fairly powerful scent, but that dissipates quite fast. All in all, a reasonably priced moisturizer for those without very dry skin, or for summer use (put the moisturizer in the fridge and it will feel great going on in the hot weather). (***Testing"

934308,2185072,"product is getting the correct radar alerts and this is where it made me sad on a highway trip over 200 miles/way.<br />1. The Unit didn't alert for multiple cruisers passing me (both directions) or multiple cruisers positioned 90 degree for you. Now, I understand the concept of LEO's keeping radar's off and visually judging before clocking you  - No machine can alert if the radar is off - fair enough. However it happened too many times (almost all the time on this trip packed with cruisers) in I wonder if its &#34;filtering&#34; valid signals on the AUTO mode.  The confirmation came almost after the 9th/10th time a highway patrol car passed me (on same direction) -  I saw him coming on my rear view mirror but still the machine is dumb, quiet  and a little after he passed me it beeped quickly for a &#34;Ka band&#34; and that vanished since the cruiser sped away from me. Of course that means he had his radar turned on and was throwing &#34;Ka&#34; and this 500 bucks unit is either A. Simply incapable of intercepting that unless its really close or B. Intercepted it but filtered it as part of its filtering logic of  &#34;false alarms&#34;.<br />2. GPS goes on and off from time to time for no reason.<br />3.

940227,2801555,"unit got really confused when I was driving through what looked like a lake on the screen.  Recalculation can be irritating as the unit repeatedly tries to force you to do U-Turns to get back on what it thinks is the best route.  I'm sure this is region specific.<br /><br />Bottom line here...don't rely on the restuarant listings.<br /><br />My next test was a little longer - it was a 25 mile drive to my mother's house.  Again, route planning was very fast (3-4 seconds).  The route was very accurate to her house but the route seemed to favor toll roads and highways.  The result was the same when I modified the preferences to prefer \\""back roads\\"" and avoid highways.  About 7 miles into the trip to mom's house, the C340 locked up completely.  I reset it and reprogrammed the route (you have to stop the car to do this safely).  Then, 5 miles down the road it locked up again.  I checked for later firmware when I got home and there was none, but an email to customer support was all it took to get a firmware update that resolved this issue.<br /><br />So with various other tests, I give it a ~90% chance of picking the correct route to wherever you are going (at least in my area)...but often times it does get you where you intend to go but takes you far out of the way.  A few major highways are missing from the basemap in my area, which were corrected when I paid $75 for the 2006 map update.  Common sense and a backup map are sometimes necessary.<br /><br />Ok, about the unit itself...the text to speech is worth the extra money of you are considering buying it for that reason.  Text to Speech pronunciation has been corrected with several firmware revisions.  I have not had any major issues with the text-to-speech pronunciation since these firmware updates were applied.<br /><br />The screen is bright and the whole thing is smaller than I expected - but there really is no excuse for being upset about the size when you can go to Best Buy or Circuit City and see it for yourself.<br /><br />So:<br />Pros - bright screen, doesn't wash out too bad (I have deeply tinted windows) and speech volume is appropriate.  Planning is quick.<br />It is very accurate on where to turn, giving ample time for braking or lane changing.<br /><br />Cons - with earlier firm revisions it used to lock up frequently, power cable goes to mounting base, routing not accurate in many cases, and some POI are incorrect.  Searching an address is glacially slow.  Shows many obscure restuarants but overlooks the mainstream ones. Some of the cardinal directions are reversed.  I was going to get on an expressway going east and the directions said to go west.  (The drawn map was correct, just the speech was wrong)<br /><br />Bottom line is that after using this for routine trips around town as well as jaunts into unfamiliar areas, I recommend it.<br /><br />Update: 11/25/05: On Thanksgiving day I took a longer trip of about 50 miles.  Set to use WAAS, the C340 locked up at exactly tyhe same point as in my previous review"

949234,3160368,"product provides essential and nonessential amino acids.<br /><br />This powder not only has a broad profile of essential vitamins and minerals, it is filled with diet-aids (Lecithin, Spirulina, Choline and Inositol) and enzymes (Bromelain and Papaya). You also get the added benefit of cleansing ingredients (Chlorophyll) and Fiber (Bran, Cellulose and Apple Pectin).<br /><br />Ingredients: Micro-filtered whey protein concentrate, fructose, di-calcium phosphate, xanthan gum, vanilla flavor, fructooligosaccharides (FOS - supports the growth of probiotics/healthy bacteria), guar gum, psyllium, maltodextrin, potassium citrate, magnesium oxide, microcrystalline cellulose, spirulina, vitamin C, vitamin E acetate, choline bitarate (plays a role in the metabolism of fats), inositol (helps the liver process fats), apple pectin, bee pollen, niacinamide, vitamin A palmitate, zinc oxide, manganese sulfate, ferrous fumarate, calcium pantothenate, lecithin, lemon bioflavonoids (from lemons and an important for collagen formation), papaya (digestive enzyme), bromelain, chlorophyll, pyridoxine HCL, riboflavin, thiamine HCL, vitamin B-12, ergocalciferol (a form of Vitamin D), folic acid, biotin, potassium iodine, chromium chloride, sodium selenite, sodium molybdate...and LOVE. No really, they list Love as an ingredient.<br /><br />While you don't need a blender, I'd recommend a shaker. I find this blends well with a variety of ingredients. You may enjoy making your own shake variations in the blender. This powder tastes best when blended with very cold juice or milk.<br /><br />You may also want to try the Chocolate and Strawberry varieties. You can drink a shake before or after a workout or drink a shake daily to nourish your body with high-quality nutrients. Nature's Plus is a company that is known for their dedication to quality. They have 21 quality control procedures to ensure the potency of their products. Not only do they use the highest quality raw materials from reputable suppliers, they also take great care to produce products with only all-natural ingredients.<br /><br />If you enjoy this product, I have a feeling you will love the All-One Nutritech products. They have an incredible Fruit Antioxidant Dietary Supplement and a rather tasty Totally Fiber Product you can sprinkle on yogurt.<br /><br />Also try the \\""Tangerine Dream\\"" soy protein powder with<br /><br />orange juice.

972148,633430,"unit is given an email address and 60 download credits (which allows the transaction). It has its own built in wi-fi adapter and automatically connects to a cellular network (no hassle).<br /><br />I really enjoyed the crisp quality of the pictures and the ability to receive photos by email. This feature would be useful for people who receive more photos than they take themselves (e.g. long distance grandparents). The ease of instant use was a big plus, even if the setup of other items was more complicated.<br /><br />The unit has a few downsides too. Unless it's hung from the wall, it's not terribly sturdy. Mine fell over a couple of times while I was trying it out, which can't be good for it. Also, a person using the photo mail feature frequently will incur additional charges after 60 uses, annoying given its high initial price tag. Finally, the email feature is outdated, given Facebook and other technologies to photo share.<br /><br />Overall, this is a decent product. I'm an avid photographer and love how it makes my DSLR photos look crisp and natural. I didn't mind the setup and don't find the other features too much of a hassle. It meets my needs, but then again, I don't use it a lot or use a lot of the features.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />I've revised my review"

986307,3231310,"unit gets plugged in where you want your new Ethernet port to be (in my case, the livingroom near my Apple TV). From there, you can run the second included Ethernet cable from that unit to whatever device (or hub/router) you want to use. Within minutes I had a functional Ethernet port in my livingroom.<br /><br />I was untrusting of this (what if a neighbor bought one and out powerlines shared some common grounding or something between apartment units)? Fortunately, the Powerline has the option of an encrypted connection. All you had to do was press the security button one one unit, then press it on the second unit within two minutes. Iam unable to test the level of this encryption or even if it is working, though.<br /><br />My Apple TV immediately recognized it had an Ethernet connection and I did some tests. While my buffering did not go away completely, it did reduce -- much to my surprise. Perhaps this was a coincidence, or perhaps WiFi overhead (and interference, and slower speed) was causing some of it. (Still, I don't blame the WiFi entirely. Buffering was very rare when I had a 40Mbs DSL connection for awhile).<br /><br />I think the biggest advantage of this type of product is not needing to buy WiFi adapters for things like older TiVos or a printer. Anything with an Ethernet port could plug in to one of these units, then the other could connect to the Ethernet port on your router and join your WiFi and &#34;wired&#34; devices. So far, it works great, and I would have likely invested in one of these much earlier if I had known how convenient it is. So far, I have had no issues.<br /><br />The product states you can buy additional units and have up to sixteen (16!) wireless Ethernet ports throughout your home or office. This may not work for everyone, though. A friend of mine has an old house without grounded outlets which he says prevents these devices from working. But, for most, unless you are writing your house with faster than gigabit Ethernet ports, this may eliminate your need to ever run physical cables.<br /><br />As to how fast the 1.2Gbps connection really is, I have not done any machine-to-machine speed tests yet, but if I do, I will update this review"

Or the stuff just doesn't work at all.<br /><br />Vaseline just threw all the buzz words on this product: Intensive, Rescue, Clinical, Therapy, Lightly Fragranced (key word: lightly) so I was skeptical.  But instantly won over.  Perhaps they've been in the business so long they've finally worked out an almost perfect formula. It's fairly thick, but smoothes on easily, not leaving you feeling greasy, and it keeps my elbows, at least, from looking and feeling like pink and white coconut husk.<br /><br />But I've never understood why a moisturizer needs fragrance at all, even though this fragrance is indeed hardly noticeable.

Looking at the constructions of high end stylus and this product it is obvious that these products are like 'consumables' (like printer ink for example) and it does not really matter if you pay $25 or $5 dollars for a stylus - sooner or later the tip will wear out.<br /><br />IMHO, for serious touch experience one must use their finger. there is no replacement for that :-)<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review"

When it came time to update the map and the firmware, I followed the instructions on the website to a T.  The unit became stuck in an infinite loop (on startup) and defaulted to some foreign language.  I searched their technical support and tried all their remedies, to no avail.  I suspect the drive went bad, and it is past the warranty.  That said, I will be trying a Garmin this time.  I think TOM TOM has a good product but their hardware and firmware don't always perform like they ought to - which I think supports the wide spectrum of review"

I would in no way spend money on an electrician for a problem with a curling iron.

1081906,2435172,"unit gets as intense as I can stand it at about half of the intensity setting of which it's capable.<br /><br />The reason I wanted the Prospera is because unlike the Sharper Image unit, the pads are not confined to use with a belt, which means that you can apply them to areas of the body, like the neck and shoulders, that the SI unit is not intended to reach. (The SI belt is like one of those wide, elastic belts we wear to protect our backs when lifting things.) And the Prospera is good for such use; I can use the pads on my neck, shoulders, legs, upper arms, etc. But like I said, the intensity at its highest setting on the unit I received is weak compared to the SI unit. In addition, it only runs for 15 minutes at a time, whereas I can set the SI unit for 60 minutes or longer. I can and do turn the Prospera off and back on to use it for sessions longer than 15 minutes, but this is inconvenient.<br /><br />I keep referring to \\""the unit I received\\"" because based on review"

1108087,99922,"product was offered. So, no complaint there. This gadget is so self explanatory that I did not need the manual anyway.  I  absolutely love the thing!!!  I swear this is the best gadget I have every purchased.  I have a cat and a dog that both shed profusely.  I also live in the country with no pavement around my house, dirt floors in the garage, and a huge garden.  The piles of dirt that are drug into my house are immense.  This gadget picks up all that dirt very well. I have vinyl plank flooring in my kitchen and laminate flooring through the rest of the house.<br /><br />Someone did state that it would not pick up big objects and I say what vacuum will?  If I find that it is pushing the dirt rather than picking it up I tilt the machine back, place it over the big chunk, and it will pick up the dirt.  I have always had to do this with vacuums.<br /><br />This gadget came in four pieces.  The handle snapped right in and is adjustable.  The body of the machine snapped right into place on the head of the machine.  I placed the cleaning pad on the base of the machine and it snapped right into place when I sat the machine on it. There is a tab on the pad try that you step on to remove and once you get used to the idea that this is not what you have to do to tip the machine back it is great.  I just put my bare toes or stockinged foot on the machine head itself to tip it back.  I did all of this without the manual.  I did follow the other review"

At least droid users *can* pop in a fresh cell when needed!<br /><br />(below was my first impression of this battery having read how to use it and the shortcommings)<br /><br />Droid does.  Yes indeed.  Charging batteries is done by leaving the charging voltage on the battery for as long as possible (as long as plugged in) - so charging this cell is a no brainer.<br /><br />Droid calculates discharge.  Therein lies the problem.  Droid under \\""about this phone\\"" --> \\""battery usage\\"" keeps track of every mAh used and where it went.  This is nice to see what apps are really sucking the battery dry, but it's also how droid knows how much power is remaining, and it assumes 1300 mAh is the battery capacity.  But with this attached, 2600+ is the capacity.<br /><br />Example - last night I forgot to plug Droid in.  I had charged the Innocell fully yesterday.

1114380,3228651,"unit provides an LED display that monitors the vacuum and will only seal when an adequate vacuum is achieved.  But it allows users to select single versus double seal.  Multi-month storage is only realistic with a double seal.<br /><br />The dual vacuum pump makes the vacuum process much faster.  The LED monitor is very nice because after using the unit a few times, it becomes clear when the vacuum process will succeed and when it is doomed for failure.  Other units only light up when a full vacuum has been achieved.  When the bag is big, the process can take minutes.  Without the multi-level LED, progress cannot be monitored, which is very frustrating.  This a killer when using the Weston Pro 230.<br /><br />Should the average user buy this instead of the Weston Pro versions.  Without question.  The extra $50 gets you a vastly superior vacuum sealer.  However, an $80 foodsaver is more than adequate for those who dont need to store food for months.  The Titanium Game Saver is not for everyone, but it will pay for itself if you store meat for more than six weeks.<br /><br />Before presenting a list of the pros and cons, one recommendation.  I do not honor the 3&#34; separation between the seal and the contents.  Rather, I use 2&#34;.  This is possible by using a 20&#34; by 4&#34; by 6&#34; cedar board in front of the unit to hold up the bag during sealing.  (Nothing special about cedar except I already had one.)  This board allows one to easily seal even when the contents are only 2&#34; below the seal.  Otherwise, one has to hold up the bag which can be tricky to do without the help of the board.<br /><br />Summary of Pros and Cons<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1.  Beautiful piece of equipment.<br />2.  Rugged and well made.  Can handle heavy duty, nearly continuous usage.<br />3.  A dual cylinder vacuum pump makes the sealing process much faster.<br />4.  An LED display monitors vacuum progress and quickly alerts user if the process is not making progress, which often happens if a decent seal has not been created.<br />5.  Double seal capability makes a major difference for long term storage without free"

All the discs tested and verified successfully, and played on my regular DVD player.<br /><br />The disc spindle, on which the discs were stacked, was very poor, the cover would not fasten securely onto to base and the stack could not be picked up without the top and base parting. That's just an irritation. But it would be nice if Amazon's spindle were at least as good as the zillions of other spindles out there that seem to hold the discs and be \\""pick-able up-able\\"" without parting.<br /><br />As to the \\""Amazon Frustration-Free"

It was messy but I really wanted to make sure I left no stone unturned. I used alot.     I used so much I was worried to fall a sleep lol, trying to kill beg bugs may end up accidentally killing myself lol. I even place some around my bed and between the matress, of course it has protective covering. No bites next morning but shockly I found a dozen other bugs turn over on their backs dead.     Later when I return from work. I found tons of dead water roaches, I had never even seen them crawling around before, dead laying on their backs this stuff  works great so far.     The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I have not been using it long enough. But my hopes are high after seeing how it killed those other bugs. I will come back to update on the bed bugs in 1 month.    Ok so after 3 weeks the house is bedbug free"

That's good news. I never really liked the taste of the original Red Bull, but Red Bull is the only energy drink that is effective for me without giving me the jitters (unlike 5-Hour Energy).<br /><br />The taste is acceptable, but not fantastic. It tastes like pasteurized fruit juice, reminding me of acai berry shakes from Jamba Juice or a [[ASIN:B007ZSYCZO Starbucks Refreshers Raspberry Pomegranate]].. not really like cranberry at all. It lacks cranberry's characteristic tartness and astringency. Upon looking further on the can, I understood why. It's artificially flavored. I don't think the carbonation/sweetness balance is right. It's very lightly carbonated and I would've preferred more effervescence because I can't really feel the bubbles.<br /><br />Calorie and caffeine content is the same as regular Red Bull: 80 mg caffeine, 110 calories per 250 ml can (8.4 oz). The pull tab has a bright red color that matches the can. Made in Austria. You can get a 4 pack at Walgreens for $6 when on sale (NYC area). I'm not sure how this mixes with vodka, which uses the traditional original flavor. Glad I tried this, but after my box, I won't be going back for more.Next review"

The box shows someone using the unit without a cord, but the unit is not cordless and must be plugged in.<br /><br />I have started using this on my legs and have had decent results, as, being older, my leg hair had already naturally thinned out. The areas I have treated now have almost no hair growing back after several weeks.  However, people should be aware that using this device is a very time consuming process, as each area of your body must be treated fully and slowly with the laser (and generally you only get a small area treated in one sitting). However, you only re-treat every 2 weeks, which is better than shaving every day or every other day.<br /><br />If you have the patience, then this may be a good solution for hair removal. I cannot comment on the price, as, at this time, Amazon does not have it available for purchase, so I do not know what their price is/will be. I will update this review"

1282629,164351,"product offering. With the Studio 1, you can take your show on the road and podcast from just about anywhere. In addition to the carrying case, the Studio 1 Desktop Recording Kit includes: a desktop microphone (see the Technical Specs on the product page for the details) with a built in monitoring jack, desktop stand and adapter, and a 10' USB cable.<br /><br />I really like the combination of equipment at this price point. High marks to MXL for producing a well equipped desktop recording kit that will fit the needs of most new podcasters and produce immediate dividends in terms of production quality. For additional information regarding the features of the Studio 1 jump to the product page.<br />USABILITY<br />Most professional podcasters will use a pro level condenser or cardioid based Mic that employs an XLR connector (professional level audio connection system) which is then plugged into an audio mixer board and then digitized through some sort of USB based digital converter. The newly converted digital signal is then routed into the computer via the USB port where a program like Audacity or GarageBand can record the digital audio signal.<br /><br />This can be a very complicated process involving expensive equipment, different drivers required to allow the computer to recognize the connected equipment, and a great deal of configuration. Yes, the result will be deep rich audio that brings a professional broadcast quality to your project, but at what cost? This solution is not for those who are light of cash or technical acumen.<br /><br />MXL has eliminated the exorbitant expense and configuration issues of the traditional Mic setup by manufacturing an entry level pro Mic that leverages the USB audio systems built into today's operating systems. By building the USB technology into the hardware of the Studio 1, MXL has produced an entry level pro Mic that is truly Plug & Play. All you need to record great audio, is a computer with a USB port, a recording application (more on this later), and a pair of headphones for monitoring.<br /><br />Assembling the Studio 1 was a breeze. Simply screw on the adaptor to the bottom of the mic,<br /><br />then the stand into the bottom of the adaptor,<br /><br />plug the USB cable into the bottom of the Mic,<br /><br />and finally, the other end of the USB cable into your computer.<br /><br />The next step was to select the Studio 1 in the Sound Preferences Panel.<br /><br />Now you are ready to use your favorite recording application such as GarageBand or the free"

1286363,1939187,"unit gets a 5/5 rating - with the caveat that you have to understand that you are locked into paying them eternally for its usage. So think of it as a NetFlix account, where you keep paying each month (or each year) to get continued access to the system.<br /><br />UPDATE AFTER ONE WEEK:<br /><br />The unit has held up nicely, including going into a sauna. It is so lightweight that even while golfing it is completely unnoticeable (which is of course important). It gets great kudos for doing its job in a very unobtrusive manner. Compared against a variety of pedometers and other tracking devices it is accurate.<br /><br />The website's nutrition area was useful and easy to use. Updating and maintaining daily menus was simple. Having the stats there helped motivate more healthy eating. One downside is that the stats for a given day show you red and green as a simple color of reaching or not reaching a goal. So for example if my goal was to eat 40% of my daily intake as protein, it would calculate that to grams and then show me red all day long for protein until I crossed that level. I get no indicator if I'm close or far from my goal - I.e. should I eat a lot of protein at lunch or just a little. A bar graph would be much more helpful, to glance at and know what my remaining meals should look like.<br /><br />The website's exercise area does its job. You tell the system what types of exercises you enjoy, and they let you know what you'd need to do in each to reach your calorie goals. Their options are a wide range of activities from walking the dog to canoeing to gym equipment. So whatever it is you enjoy, the system will offer ideas with that in mind.<br /><br />We were a bit disappointed on day week-plus-one. The system had kept saying it would revamp our goals and assign us an \\""animal symbol\\"" once we got through the initial evaluation"

By helping to stabilize my legs when I begin to tremble then full on shake, then fall, these give me just that little &#34;something&#34;, that level of support that helps me. They seem VERY well made. Since I will be wearing these for hours at a time, every single day and sweating a lot requiring frequent washing etc, I promise to follow up to see if these hold up or are cheaply made. I promise you, I will know probably LONG before the average user. Because NOBODY has more at stake than myself when it comes to reason I am using these. We shall see. If these fail, I will be the first to revise this review"

1327574,2925323,"unit gets stuck, do your best to NOT pick it up.  Once it leaves the floor (not just the wheels lifting up) the home base is lost and it starts all over.  It may recognize where it cleaned by the surroundings but where home is, 90% of the time will be lost.  Once it finishes the cycle it just cleans the last spot over and over until it dies unless you take it home. **Depending on home base placement and where you picked it up, it may find its way home.  Getting lost ended up being our fault by adjusting home base while it was off cleaning, so it came back to find home had left and gave up.  Similarly if you pick it up it may just cruse around looking for home when done thinking it know's where it was but ultimately cannot find it. **After identifying the only places it was getting stuck I made one small furniture adjustment, and place a soup can under the kitchen cabinet that was cut a bit too low.  It doesn't get stuck there every time, just depends on how it enters that area.  Once I made my adjustments and realized that picking it up was a bad thing, I have never again seen it get lost, spend time cleaning the same spot over and over or any issues with it getting home.  It did randomly get stuck behind a box it had pushed out of the way(donations temporarily in the dining room).  I lifted the box and placed it on the table, that is the one time it ran out of juice and had to fill up to finish.  2.)  The bin in this thing is fairly well sized considering the small stature of the unit.  No it is not massive but it is very adequate.  The first few regular runs may require a mid vacuum empty but the more frequently you use it, the more it can hold.  With my two pets I try to empty it after every use, but I am not always able to.  I can get 2 uses before its full, 3 before its compacted and the unit asks for an empty.  Again I am running it every 2 to 3 days and what I noticed was the amount of dirt particles being picked up diminished into just fir and small bits of kitty litter / odds and ends.  This meant that most of the dust / dirt had been picked up which was great.  3.) The battery is not huge, but can last about 90 minutes on a charge before it needs to refill.  For me it takes the unit about 60 to 70 minutes to clean my downstairs: kitchen & living, Dining, side hall's, main entry, laundry / mud room.  Your mileage may vary depending on how many twists turns and obstacles it has to clean around.  I think it lasts very well considering the suction power and distance this thing travels each use.  My whole house is 2150 square feet and over half of that is the downstairs.  4.) Quality of this unit seems higher than expected.  I have seen a few complaints of broken lidar units within warranty period and that happens, sucks but it happens.  My unit has been flawless so far.  I have seen other complaints on the filters, brushes and such which I cannot recreate as explained in my next topic.  Overall though the unit is well built out of mostly plastic on the external that will scuff, scratch and show wear but a wipe / rub down keeps it looking good unless your up close and personal.  Most of the quality issues I read about were for older models but I could see maintenance issues getting something built up in the lidar unit causing a problem.  Maintenance: This is where I think a lot of concerns can crop up with quality issues.  As I explained I try to empty the bin after each run to help air flow, I don't always make it but eh it happens.  When I do empty the unit I take out the filter, pull off any hair or fluff stuck to it, and give it several bangs on the side of the trash can to remove loose dirt and other obstructions from the filter.  Not only will this lengthen the life of the filter (maybe by a negligible amount) but it keeps air flowing and the suction strong.  This is why you replace the air filter in your AC every 3 to 4 months (or should).  By doing so the motor wont get stressed and the unit should be happier, longer.  Today was the first time I fully performed maintenance besides just emptying it, filter work and replacing the filter.  It is fairly easy to know when the filter needs to go as you will see &#34;easy&#34; material being left behind.  Recently I noticed a lot being left behind, I had thought my wife was not running it as much but that was not the case.  I flipped the unit over and was absolutely shocked at how clogged the brush was.  I am used to cutting hair out of my hand held unit once a year but this unit needs that work much more frequently.  The middle portion (where most of the suction is) was almost completely useless brush wise.  It still had suction but the bristles were so clogged it was hopeless.  Thankfully you simply lift the holding plate off and can remove the entire brush (quite easy).  It took about 5 minutes to clean and now it is back in the vacuum for another 4 to 5 months before another cleaning.  I believe due to the lower overall suction and rotational speed vs a hand held more material gets stuck.  While I was doing that I gave the unit a wipe down and quick vacuum itself from my shop vac to remove other debris and dust.  Today I put in the third filter since purchasing the unit, replaced the first side brush and cleaned the roller.  I do wish the filters would last a bit longer, I may try to shop vac this one and see if I can get another few weeks out of it.  That is fairly nit picky though as my hand held requires more pricey filters (yeah, plural) that only last longer due to less frequent use.  The side brush probably could have kept going but at only 75 cents I figure 1.5 replacements a year will be fine.  The main roller should last well beyond a year with regular cleaning.  Maintenance is not fun, but it took about the time I was spending on daily vacuuming ONCE in 6 months, so a small price to pay for the amount of time this thing has given back to me.  So wonderful to push go, and come home to a clean floor to plop my daughter on and play with her.  Other thoughts: I have not messed with the programmable stuff yet simply due to the soup can and depending on time frames I don't move my daughters play pen etc so I just push go when I need it.  Spot cleaning is great, but I wish it had the option to pick a more general geometric shape, size it small, medium or large and then get the area more clean.  Right now spot cleaning just barely falls short of my main area rug.  The unit has sensors on the two front corners.  One of their uses is for your &#34;no go&#34; zone which is handled through a small plastic magnet tape roll.  It looks more like tile / wood floor separation and is not awesome looking.  while it mostly functions depending on placement the sensors may not pick it up and keep going.  I used to use these in a small part of the mud room but gave up as the unit kept driving mostly over it before realizing it was not supposed to be there.  Another minor adjustment and I don't care anymore.  I thought about using the tape by my PC to keep it out of there and let it clean the upstairs but the computer and most cabled components are worth more than 4 times this unit so doing it by hand is no price to pay to ensure safety.  I like the tape idea, I just wish it was better implemented.  I know that can be difficult because of all the different types of flooring but the magnetic part should be slightly more sensitive to pick up immediately.  It worked great in the middle of the tile / wood floor, but not great where I needed it.  Conclusion: All in all this is NOT a replacement for your hand held vacuum.  However it is one of the best assistants you could ask for (until they make it better :p).  I pull the hand held out maybe once a month if that thanks to this guy and my house has never been cleaner and fur free"

1335616,399109,"unit supplied yet - will report back on that. Videographers might note that there is an external mike that works with the hotshoe and uses no cables at all, nice!<br /><br />In general, I find the NX1000 easy to use, the manual focus works well, the Smart mode seems to do fairly well, there are a great many scene modes and other (somewhat gimmicky) features (Magic filters/frames, etc.).  I enjoyed playing with those on the WB150F, but they seem out of place here.  There are a superb number of image adjustments, exposure tweaks, and  controls of a more serious nature as well. When you want to get serious, this camera is ready.  Also, some of  the fun things, like the Panorama mode, do work well if you understand their limitations and keep your expectations reasonable.<br /><br />As expected, the APS-C sensor renders a lot of good image detail. This is the big plus for this camera. I was very pleased with the results under good lighting conditions.  I shoot a lot of landscape and street stuff, and this camera seems well suited for that.  The noise reduction seems to work well up to about 1600 or so (maybe 800 for purists).  Colors are accurate and not over-saturated like on many consumer cameras.  If you like the &#34;boost&#34; many cameras give by default, there is a &#34;Vivid&#34; mode which will do this for you.  Personally, I prefer the more realistic colors (one of the things I like about Olympus and (most) Panasonics as well).Sharpness is good in JPEGs (I have not shot RAW yet) and tones are nice and smooth (think large expanses of blue sky and clouds).  I'm sure with experience my results will improve over these initial test shots, so that bodes well.  If you like to print big, 16x20, even 20x30 possibly, you will be able to do so, which is very nice.<br /><br />The 20-50mm kit lens is nice enough, but has a very limited range compared to what I am used to.  (I am considering getting the 30mm lens which I think would make a nice compact package for everyday use.)  However, the images look good, sharp, detailed, so I am happy with it.  Video worked well and the zoom worked fine in video mode and was silent.  In casual use, there is no need to switch the dial to video mode, you can just press the Video button on the back and after a slight pause you're in action.  This is nice.  Of course, dialing to full video mode gives you more options.<br /><br />Wifi features worked fine, I was able to easily connect and save pics using the autobackup mode.  Skydrive and others worked fine.  Have not tried the mobile link and remote view finder apps yet. (Update:  I tried these apps out and they worked OK for the most part.  A bit flaky at times.  There is a new &#34;Smart Camera app&#34; to replace these, but it only works with the new firmware.  Since I have not yet upgraded the firmware, have not tried it.)  The PC_Autobackup mode works very well for transferring pics and movies to your PC.  It remembers what has been transferred and only transfers new items.  Best to transfer frequently, since slower than reading from a card, but all automatic and very convenient.  [You can also transfer photos to your mobile devices (phone/tablet) using the other apps (Mobile Link/Smart Camera).]<br /><br />Example: You get back from shooting, you activate the PC-Autobackup on the camera (your laptop/PC and network must be on, of course), and the camera will connect and begin transferring your content.  When done the camera will turn-off (unless you press a control button within 30 seconds) and you can set the PC to shutdown as well if you like.  Or you can select the &#34;open folder&#34; choice on the PC/notenook popup dialog and view your pics and movies.  All very easy and convenient.<br /><br />There is a &#34;Smart Range&#34; feature to extend  dynamic range and preserve highlights.  It seems to work well, but you lose shadow detail. Might want to turn off by default, I think.  (You can also shoot RAW and tweak things  yourself, of course.)<br /><br />JPEGS look very good to me with a lot of detail and sharpness.  So good that I think shooting JEPG only is feasible with the NX1000.  (You can always switch to RAW or RAW+Jpeg when needed, of course.)  I think many will find the Jpegs entirely adequate for most purposes.  (If you shoot a lot at high ISO's you would definitely want to shoot RAW.)  You have a range of aspect ratios including 1:1, 3:2, and 16:9.  This is nice and gives you flexibility in camera versus cropping later.<br /><br />The 8fps burst mode worked very well, though as has been noted everywhere, there is a lag as the camera processes the shots before you can shoot again.  I am a fairly deliberate photographer and don't shoot much action/sports, so the NX1000 is fine for me.  The occasional lags when switching modes and after bursts or RAW shots are not an issue for me, but could be for some.  It's all covered in many of the excellent online review"

1337856,2697410,"unit offered by Magellan. One must ask how Magellan can offer so much at a price that is so reasonable. What RoadMate features has been eliminated for this new Magellan RoadMate 1470?     Answer: Nothing, Magellan gave us everything at a price that is unbelievable!    The NEW Magellan RoadMate 1470 offered at a price of less than $239 and is currently the best value for your dollar. This full feature Portable Navigation Device offers all the features you will need to route from point A to Point B anywhere in North America, Puerto Rico and even Mexico if you select to purchase the optional unlock code for this expandable GPS device. Magellan have introduced the most affordable full feature GPS currently available and I feel they have accomplished this successfully.    The Magellan RoadMate 1470 offers so much more, it is BIGGER, Thinner, Smarter and faster than all the older GPS system offered by Magellan at a competitive price similar to the older RoadMate units. Currently this MRM 1470 is the lowest GPS priced available that offers a large 4.7\\"" display with full features including full map coverage of NA map and expandable to Mexico and future Europe maps loaded in a Micro SD card as an option.    How is this entire GPS product possible at the price it is selling for? It offers a much bigger display, 4.7\\"" diagonally and yet the overall physical size is slimmer than a GPS that offers a 4.3\\"" display. It includes smarter features such as OneTouch, quick spell, smart city search, this unit will find street address or POI you are looking for much faster than what is currently available on the GPS market. This unit is Faster and have the ability to search through the entire NAmap data base without having to select different map regions such as Canada, Alaska, Mexico to start a route, it covers the entire NA mapping software in one region so one would not have to fumble around switching regions to route to a destination that is not in the lower 48 states. These RoadMate 1470 also calculates a route much faster and offers not one route but 4 different route options. Route options such as Fastest time, Shortest distant, Most use of free"

The first level of all games are fairly easy but as she gets farther, it gets a little more difficult. She can't play Level 2 on most games yet because they use math concepts and she isn't ready for the addition/subtraction just yet.<br /><br />We have had no problems described by other review"

The blades are supposed to be self-sharpening and the battery is currently (sorry, loose pun attack) very peppy and lasts plenty long enough for more than one haircut now.    In order to get the really uniform length that makes for a sharp appearance it does take lots of repetitive passes over the same hair spot, but the batteries are well up to this challenge.  Are you?  If you are looking for a one or two pass sort of thing, then you need to look at some much more pricey pro equipment, I imagine, (and maybe hiring a barber to use it, too).  This thing gets me free"

So I picked one up here, saving twenty over the mallwart price, and am very happy with it, barring the above caveats.<br /><br />The best way to deal with no delete feature seems to be to mark the tracks you don't dig with the \\""wishlist\\"" feature on the options screen, and then when you charge the unit you can open the files and delete tunes you've wishlisted. Much more hassle than deleting on the fly, but at least a workable solution to my main negative about the product.<br /><br />If Sony releases a firmware update that lets us delete on the fly (not sure if that's possible or not; hope so), then I'd have to give this thing an almost perfect rating.<br /><br />Pair it with Koss Portapros and you will be blown away by the sound.]<br /><br />[Edit: 5/12/10.

But supposedlylithiums also work best and last longest if one lets them drain completely once every 30 recharges or so, and then fully fills them up again. I don't know enough about batteries to confirm or deny (though I've been doing it that way and my walkman is still running a long time before needing juice), but it was a very detailed, well-written discussion by someone with a lot of experience in the field, who wasn't selling anything, and that's the kind of opinion I tend to trust.

1392069,904622,"product got approved for wide release manufacture and distribution. I did small handfuls of leaves as the manual states and even this resulted in constant clogging. After about every 5 handfuls I had to make sure it was turned off and reach in and clean out. Don't bother taking the plastic top off because it is not shaped exactly as needed to align easily and when removing as well as attempting to put this back on the experience was 10 times more difficult because the legs kept unlocking.<br />3. You are given a bag of the weed whacker type ties that are used to shred. In the manual it states you should only buy their specially manufactured ties for this product. How nice of them, you think when you realize you've been given 20 extra replacement lines included in your purchase. HA! Small twigs and wet leaves destroy these things easily. Had to replace the ties about every 10 small handfuls. Once again don't bother taking off the plastic tub. Unplug the product and have a screwdriver or small knife handy to remove the ties and replace them. Get used to this process which will waste about 5 mins each time (if you're lucky and the legs don't unlock and adjust while you are attempting to do so.<br />4. The manual says the product requires minimal maintenance. There are several settings, one especially for wet leaves. Only put in 1 handful of wet leaves at a time vs the two handfuls at a time for dry leaves. Even following these instructions it constantly clogged. Unplug the machine, reach your gloved hand in and remove all the dirt, mud and other residue that has built up and once again rendered your machine worthless in a matter of minutes. This debris builds up quickly because for reasons unbeknownst to logic the bottom of this machine doesn't have large openings for material to fall through into the bag. There are four small openings within the plasticpiece which cause residue to build up quickly, more easily breaks the plastic ties and takes far longer for the machine to clear and have the leaves placed in the bag. After about 4 attempts of the bag filling up slightly, rubbing the plastic legs and causing them to unlock and add about 10 more minutes off maintenance I said no more bags thinking things would work far better. After not having a bag there you will also realize rather quickly that it doesn't shred the leaves very finely. This would've required me doing about 3 runs of processing on each handful of leaves. More wasted time.<br />5. How valuable is your time??? As said before you probably only need this if you have a lot of leaves. I had cleared about 20 contractor bags of leaves out of the yard before I said, no more trips to the landfill and theres still probably 15-20 contractor bags worth left over. The irony here is if you have minimal leaves you don't need this and if you have a lot of leaves, well this machine is not well built enough, reliable or powerful enough to get the job done. If you have a small amount then just rake them into a bag lined trash can, tie it up and call it a day or mow them and shred in a matter of minutes. You'd even be better off buying a large tub or bucket, dropping the leaves by hand in there and then placing a weed whacker in it . Then repeat that process. That would save you a tremendous amount of time and effort. Oh yeah put in headphones or earplugs because this piece of work is incredibly loud, which was hilarious given how ineffective it was at doing its job and the lack of power it seemed to have. Loud bark and no bite and your neighbors will despise you quickly. The vacuum feature to suck the leaves downward to shred is not as strong as you would think given how loud this baby is and so when you feed leaves be prepared to put your gloved hand or the end of a rake, shovel etc to move the leaves to feed it. This wastes even more time of an already bad process. So the process is this. You'd already need to have leaves raked into piles or maybe in a garbage can. You really cant dump the can into the machine because it will clog. So after you've got your pile ready now you need to grab a handful or two at a time. Wait to see that each handful clears the machine completely and then drop your next handful or two into the plastic tub portion. Make sure that as you wait to drop the next handful you pick out any and all small twigs, debris, roots, etc otherwise its going to get jammed in a matter of minutes. Also, unless your yard is completely flat this is not a real mobile machine. It's light and easy to move but you'll need to go through the cumbersome process of adjusting and readjusting which means bring all your leaves to one large pile or separate into multiple piles throughout but prepare to deal with the adjustment process so the machine will avoid falling over while running.<br />From a value perspective, assuming things worked near as expected this thing is overpriced $120-$150? Should be about $75 tops which you'll realize once you see and feel the material especially with the legs which are of bad material and undersized which makes this a top heavy machine. Expect to spend time and money replacing the shredder lines, prepare to be disappointed about its effectiveness, the waste of your time for a product that was supposed to save you time and be fully aware of your refund deadline.<br /><br />*I decided to let Amazon send a replacement shredder in and effort to determine if mine was defective. I have not used it yet since I received it in the evening however as I am putting it together I am noticing significant scuffs on the funnel/feeder cover portion as well as various yellow discolorations showing on the green plastic. This replacement has clearly been used and then sold and shipped as &#34;New&#34;. I will update the review"
1392578,734850,"product gets five stars for its fancy and colorful packaging. Unfortunately that's not edible :) The bag is a lot bigger than it needs to be as it contains just 4.5 ounces of chips. 1oz of chips is the serving size which is 130 calories and according to the packaging, 1oz is one full serving of vegetables. It has 3g of protein, no cholesterol, 7g fat (0.5g saturated, 0g trans), 140mg sodium (6% RDA), 17g carbs (3g fiber, 1g sugars), 35% Vitamin A and tiny percentages of iron, Vitamin C and calcium.

Then there's potato starch, carrot, sweet potato, maltodextrin, sea salt, onion powder, sugar, konjak flour, garlic powder, citric aid and the biggest loophole of all, natural flavor.

1392668,429697,"item given the date change. I then decided to buy a 360 game to play and utilize the new features of my Xbox and I got Call of Duty 4. The game was terrific and I quickly became addict to it, I then started to use the console more often. About three weeks ago, I came home from the office and turned on the console, the disc tray made a strange noise and there seemed to be no disc on it as the dashboard had the `Open Tray' text in it, I was almost certain I hadn't removed the game so I checked, the game was indeed in the tray, the console would simply not recognize a disc in it. I tried CDs, DVDs and other games and got the same result, no disc was recognized at all and the tray made noises every time I opened/closed it.<br /><br />The console had a warranty note asking you not to go back to the retailer in a case like this as they may not be `as well prepared as their technicians' and contact their support center instead. I did that and after waiting on the line for a while a person finally answered, I had to struggle with them as they could barely speak English, since I do speak Spanish I tried to make it easier for the guy, I don't know which part of south America they're from but even in Spanish I had a hard time understanding what he was saying and had the guy repeat almost everything he said. This person asked me to contact my supplier first and see if warranty applied (even though the warranty info on the box asks you to go to Microsoft first), the reason for that he said, was that the supplier could simply change the unit and provide me with a new one. He told me I could mail them my console to fix it, but if that were the case, it was likely that they would simply replace the disc drive with a used one, if the console need to be changed, they could mail me back a refurbished one at the risk of it being an older unit without the features of the one I purchased (of course, had I purchased their extended service contract they would `gladly' send me a new unit free"

1394349,198295,"Unit provided by SACO assisted the 14th Air Force in recognizing and destroying Japanese vessels and facilities.    SACO played a major role in the 14th Air Force System of patrol in the China Sea-Phillipines Sea area which was of direct operational value to the Pacific Fleet. In October 1944 it gave the first intelligence of an approaching Japanese Carrier Task Force during the crucial battle for Leyte Gulf.    On their side the Chinese provided guerillas to protect the American observers. For their role the Navy trained and armed these guerillas, who later used their new weapons and \\""new skills in modern warfare and formed demolition squads to kill Japanese, blow up trains and destroy or capture great quantities of enemy material and equipment. Soon they wanted American observers to accompany them and requested that the American instructors whom they admired so much should plan their operations with them and assist in leading them in combat. SACO demolition squads became an important force in the war in China, giving reliable and effective service in many assignments under the campaign plans \\""of the Generalissimo and Lieutenant General Albert Wedemeyer, his Chief of Staff and Commander of all U.S. Forces in the China Theater.    In the early years of the war, Chinese guerillas had lost in combat approximately three men for every Jap killed. SACO-trained and equipped guerillaspromptly increased the toll of Jap losses in casualties, equipment and supplies and in 1945 reversed the ratio and killed more than 2,000 Japs a month at a cost of less than one Chinese for three Japs.    Used chiefly in ambushes, raids on outposts, patrols and small garrisons these troops struck repeatedly against roving Japs out on search for food in rural areas. By repeatedly wiping out these foraging groups, SACO guerillas cut enemy food supplies and made the Japanese afraid to venture from their strongholds except in force, in some areas the guerilla pressure was so great that Japanese soldiers were weakened seriously by starvation.    Demolition work against highways, railroads and river traffic was effective in cutting enemy communication routes. Sabotage experts employing explosives did wholesale destruction to barracks, assembly halls, factories, storage dumps and warehouses.    Raids against anchored Japanese vessels and small craft resulted in the sinking of many vessels and capture of others. In one of many such raids a sabotage unit of Chinese and Americans attacked a freighter of 1,000 tons docked in Amoy at night early this year, using delayed charges to kill or injure all personnel aboard, destroy the freighter and throw the Amoy area into confusion. Other sabotage units developed special tactics for operations against river and lake craft in the Yangtze River Lake area and were successful in attacks on this Japanese supply route at many points.    SACO guerillas from June 1, 1944, to July 1, 1945, killed 23,540 Japs, wounded 9,166 and captured 291. They destroyed 209 bridges, 84 locomotives, 141 ships and river craft, and 97 depots and warehouses. SACO activities have been inspected in recent months by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, United States Ambassador Patrick J. Hurley and Lieutenant General Wedemeyer and received high praise from each.    Maintaining constant pressure against Jap garrisons along the China coast, SACO troops were prominent inthe liberation of Foochow and Wenchow. Some SACO units, including several Chinese Naval Officers were trained in the United States for amphibious work. These units captured and occupied several of the smaller Jap-held islands along the China coast.    Recognizing the special difficulties in keeping Japs and puppets from infiltrating into Free"

1432672,738047,"unit gives you a second (smaller) blade for cutting tiny plate grooves (handy for making small things using FF bisquit).  It is very easy to adjust the depth of the cut, and a knob allows you to adjust it incrementally without the whole thing going out of whack (like the Freud does when you loosen the fence).  The depth gauge works well.  It's set up to be fast and easy to use.  Mine came perfectly adjusted for use the first time (the Freud I tried first did not).  The fence is very flexible to use.  The sandpaper on the machine helps keep it exactly where you set it on the work.<br /><br />TIP 1: be careful that you don't press down at all when you power it on.  If it is down even a 1/8\\"", the blade tip will snag the work and move away from the line.  You can recover easily by repositioning the cutter and trying again, and no damage is done.  Also, the torque in the motor can be enough to move the machine from the center line; the sandpaper helps this.<br /><br />TIP 2: There is a minor design problem with using the unit with fence set to 0 degrees.  For more on the problem, and a simple solution, search the web for \\""pc557 fence alignment\\"" (without quotes).<br /><br />(ADDED July 2008) TIP 3: Rockler dot com makes a three-sided bisquit gauge, sizes 20, 10, and 00, that is great for preview"

In summary, it is a very well conceived device that operates independently of land based equipment to track your progress, send OK messages, send personal \\""need assistance\\"" messages or send HELP messages to authorities. By adding exact position information it ends one of the greatest problems in search and rescue from the urban jungle to the snow covered mountains - precise location.     Device is useless without registration so don't bother to buy one on the street corner.     Note that it requires a special type of battery. Having spares is common sense.     Other than the lack of a cheat sheet the product is outstanding. HIGHLY recommended.     One thing that surprises me is that a majority of the one star review"

1443638,2560336,"unit was received in good order but, once set up, the status light is lit but the unit doesn't heat. Customer service rep \\""Jacob\\"" at Cuisinart advises no troubleshooting is possible and recommends return to Amazon. However, my own experimentation prior to my call demonstrated that a poorly inserted grill plate could fail to disable the safety interlock and that the status light is lit even when the interlock is enabled. So a poorly inserted plate COULD explain the observed problem. Of course, I had satisfied myself that this was NOT the problem in my case before placing the call.<br /><br />Cuisinart manufacturing rates one star for poor quality assurance. This, of course, could be a statistical fluke. I may be the unlucky customer in 10,000 for all I know. But, with high confidence, Cuisinart customer support rates one star for a don't-bother-us approach to troubleshooting and for failure to offer the reasonably required apology for the ruined meal that would have been cooked on the grill.<br /><br />In retrospect, I find that Google discloses a fair number of review"

1452838,1105583,"Unit provides an effective way to share external hard drives over my home Wi-Fi network.  Initial set up was straight forward, but unit would not stay in service, i.e. continually lost connection with Wi-Fi network.  Contacted Iomega for technical support using their Chat service.  That service was quick and responsive.  Although I must admit the technician I connected with was obviously an \\""English as a second language person\\"", which made communication somewhat challenging. Eventually unit started working and I honestly cannot attribute that to anything the technician suggested.    Learned unit works best when well ventilated.  Originally, had unit inside cabinet with external hard drives it serves.  There was some heat in that cabinet that produced by the hard drives.  When I touched the unit it was noticably warm.  I relocated the unit and external hard drives to an open book shelf.  That move satisfactorily addressed the heat condition.  Once moved the unit has worked flawlessly.    One irritant is the software, which must be used for the unit to operate.  Daily I receive notice there is an upgrade to the software.  If I have downloaded the upgrade, I have downloaded and installed the upgrade twenty times in the last month. Sometimes I will download and install the upgrade, reboot the computer,  and receive a notice that a software upgrade is available when the computer reboots!

Immediately upon viewing the slim lined pens that are designed for 'her', I felt I had a womanly responsibility to my female colleagues.  So, I ran around the building telling them in no uncertain terms to drop their clunky male oriented pens.  I was in raptures being able to tell them that they no longer needed to struggle with gender inappropriate writing utensils.<br /><br />The ululation of joy that arose when my fellow women realised they were emancipated from having to use male pens was uplifting to hear.  Our fingers will no longer be cramped trying to shape them around over large male pens.  Our wrists will no longer be sore from bearing the weight of the 'designed for men' pens.  We will no longer develop unwomanly upper arm muscles when carrying those very heavy boxes of mens pens to the stationary cupboard.  We will no longer have to bear the dark looks of our male colleagues when we use the pens that are designed for them, for their use.<br /><br />I have ordered several boxes of pens.

1471159,2219519,"product gives me around the eyes, but I'm not fond of the &#34;illuminating&#34; part.  Being middle aged, I shy away from sparkly products because they tend to point out my wrinkles and flaws.  There seems to be some mica or other reflective ingredient in this moisturizer, so I only used it a couple of times.  My daughters, who are 19 and 20, love it!  They often use off-white eye shadow and concealer near their eyes, and this was perfect for them.  I've gotten them started early with products to protect and rejuvenate their skin, so they don't end up wrinkled before their time.<br /><br />Overall this is a very nice eye cream that hydrated perfectly.  But like I said, the shiny ingredient in it didn't work for me.<br /><br />I received a complimentary Beauty Bridge set of moisturizers and serums, for testing"
1471408,3059791,"product provides a much-needed addition to my post-swim moisturizing. Between the sun and the chlorine (not to mention aging skin with too much sun exposure decades ago), my skin is pretty thirsty when I'm done. The pool provides lotion, but the ingredients read like a shopping list for a chemistry lab.<br /><br />This moisturizer goes on easily, with no scent (my strong preference, and a big plus for the OZ products). It is not greasy. I can get dressed without getting the cream smeared all over my clothes. Hours later, my skin still feels smooth but a tiny bit dry. (I have very dry skin, though.)<br /><br />The product does seem a bit pricy, at $24.99, but I haven't done a thorough job of comparison-shopping.<br /><br />I love this Vitamin E cream, [[ASIN:B0018ODYOQ Now Foods - Vitamin E Cream 28,000 IU 4 oz.]]but I don't want to overdo it on the Vitamin E. So, the OZ product is more appropriate for daily, all-over use.<br /><br />One concern: I've noticed this product line and now one other listing the first ingredient as \\""Organic Herbal Infusion.\\""  I'm not sure how FDA regulations allow this kind of nebulous description, especially in the primary ingredient. I suspect it's water that's been steeped in herbs. Which herbs? What kind of water (distilled? tap?). We don't know.<br /><br />The rest of the ingredients seem fine to me. Another review"

1489216,780993,"unit supplied yet - will report back on that. Videographers might note that there is an external mike that works with the hotshoe and uses no cables at all, nice!<br /><br />In general, I find the NX1000/1100 easy to use, the manual focus works well, the Smart mode seems to do fairly well, there are a great many scene modes and other (somewhat gimmicky) features (Magic filters/frames, etc.).  I enjoyed playing with those on the WB150F, but they seem out of place here.  There are a superb number of image adjustments, exposure tweaks, and  controls of a more serious nature as well. When you want to get serious, this camera is ready.  Also, some of  the fun things, like the Panorama mode, do work well if you understand their limitations and keep your expectations reasonable.<br /><br />As expected, the APS-C sensor renders a lot of good image detail. This is the big plus for this camera. I was very pleased with the results under good lighting conditions.  I shoot a lot of landscape and street stuff, and this camera seems well suited for that.  The noise reduction seems to work well up to about 1600 or so (maybe 800 for purists).  Colors are accurate and not over-saturated like on many consumer cameras.  If you like the \\""boost\\"" many cameras give by default, there is a \\""Vivid\\"" mode which will do this for you.  Personally, I prefer the more realistic colors (one of the things I like about Olympus and (most) Panasonics as well). Sharpness is good in JPEGs (I have not shot RAW yet) and tones are nice and smooth (think large expanses of blue sky and clouds).  I'm sure with experience my results will improve over these initial test shots, so that bodes well.  If you like to print big, 16x20, even 20x30 possibly, you will be able to do so, which is very nice.<br /><br />The 20-50mm kit lens is nice enough, but has a very limited range compared to what I am used to.  (I am considering getting the 30mm lens which I think would make a nice compact package for everyday use.)  However, the images look good, sharp, detailed, so I am happy with it.  Video worked well and the zoom worked fine in video mode and was silent.  In casual use, there is no need to switch the dial to video mode, you can just press the Video button on the back and after a slight pause you're in action.  This is nice.  Of course, dialing to full video mode gives you more options.<br /><br />Wifi features worked fine, I was able to easily connect and save pics using the autobackup mode.  Skydrive and others worked fine.  Have not tried the mobile link and remote view finder apps yet. (Update:  I tried these apps out and they worked OK for the most part.  A bit flaky at times.  There is a new \\""Smart Camera app\\"" to replace these, but it only works with the new firmware.  Since I have not yet upgraded the firmware, have not tried it.)  The PC_Autobackup mode works very well for transferring pics and movies to your PC.  It remembers what has been transferred and only transfers new items.  Best to transfer frequently, since slower than reading from a card, but all automatic and very convenient.  [You can also transfer photos to your mobile devices (phone/tablet) using the other apps (Mobile Link/Smart Camera).]<br /><br />Example: You get back from shooting, you activate the PC-Autobackup on the camera (your laptop/PC and network must be on, of course), and the camera will connect and begin transferring your content.  When done the camera will turn-off (unless you press a control button within 30 seconds) and you can set the PC to shutdown as well if you like.  Or you can select the \\""open folder\\"" choice on the PC/notenook popup dialog and view your pics and movies.  All very easy and convenient.<br /><br />There is a \\""Smart Range\\"" feature to extend  dynamic range and preserve highlights.  It seems to work well, but you lose shadow detail. Might want to turn off by default, I think.  (You can also shoot RAW and tweak things  yourself, of course.)<br /><br />JPEGS look very good to me with a lot of detail and sharpness.  So good that I think shooting JEPG only is feasible with the NX1000.  (You can always switch to RAW or RAW+Jpeg when needed, of course.)  I think many will find the Jpegs entirely adequate for most purposes.  (If you shoot a lot at high ISO's you would definitely want to shoot RAW.)  You have a range of aspect ratios including 1:1, 3:2, and 16:9.  This is nice and gives you flexibility in camera versus cropping later.<br /><br />The 8fps burst mode worked very well, though as has been noted everywhere, there is a lag as the camera processes the shots before you can shoot again.  I am a fairly deliberate photographer and don't shoot much action/sports, so the NX1000/1100 is fine for me.  The occasional lags when switching modes and after bursts or RAW shots are not an issue for me, but could be for some.  It's all covered in many of the excellent online review"

1535360,907914,"product offered here on Amazon by Memory Foam Solutions is short by 2 inches in length which is very disappointing.<br /><br />BTW, Be forewarned! - The product does not come with any sorts of retail packaging but merely squished into a cardboard box shrunk by vacuum wrapped in a protective plastic cover! - Also it *DOES NOT* come with any sorts of cover. You will have to provide your own mattress cover to wrap this around your bed otherwise it will be slipping out of the mattress in no time.<br /><br />This also is not a true Memory Foam product as pictured by the hand print. The one I received does not keep the hand imprint the way the product page displays. It looks and feels like a cheap knock off foam product. Agreed it is a foam bed topper of some sorts it seems comfortable enough to sleep on for now but I have had it only for few days and I do not know how long this cheap foam looking mattress pad bed topper is going to last. I do not seem to have enough faith in this product based on this experiences so far.<br /><br />Buyers beware! Do not waste your money if you do care about the dimensions of TWIN XL size. I rarely give 1 star review"

1537925,3368816,"product gets 5 stars from me.<br /><br />In order to test how well the product performed I installed a new heat sink to a Core i7-920 with no changes (in other words, I used the bonding material that was already included on the heat sink). I ran for several weeks doing various core temp tests and the lowest temperature I could get on the four cores was 39C. This isn't bad, but I wanted to see what the Arctic Silver could do for me.<br /><br />I removed the heat sink, cleaned it using the Artic Silver guidelines: no lint wipes (they recommend coffee filters), and making sure it was cleaned with alcohol. Next I tempered the heat sink by putting a small pea-size drop of arctic silver onto the heat sink and rubbing it in with a finger in plastic wrap. Once again, wiping off with no lint wipe, but no further cleaning (you want the product to get into the microscopic cracks).<br /><br />Next - cleaned the processor and removed all the old bonding material. Put a thin line across the processor as described (depends on the type of CPU and direction of the cores so make SURE you visit the artic silver website and review"

(Changing from 4 stars to 5)    -------    My 1500VA (with the external Battery Pack) is connected to a 50 inch LED TV (Not 4K), Surround System with 5 speakers plus a large sub, Xfinity DVR Hub, Xfinity Phone/Internet/Router device, and a cordless phone base. To test the system, I disconnected the power, and the battery lasted for over 2 hours of use with the TV on vivid display and the sound at a fun level for watching movies with a friend. If this was an actual power outage, I would probably not use the sound system (50+ watts).  This is extremely promising!    My disappointment was in the slight hum of the device when the unit is on.  It isn't horrible, but in a home, you don't want to hear this humming noise continuously.  I thought I had pressed the power button to put the unit in standby mode until I needed it again, and it seemed to work.  To test that I was still protected with the unit in standby, I pulled the power for a moment, and from a sleep mode, it powered up without allowing any interruption to my electronics.  Now I can't get it to go to sleep again.  If anyone knows how this is supposed to work, I would gladly change my review"

Videographers might note that there is an external mike that works with the hotshoe and uses no cables at all, nice!<br /><br />In general, I find the NX1000/1100 easy to use, the manual focus works well, the Smart mode seems to do fairly well, there are a great many scene modes and other (somewhat gimmicky) features (Magic filters/frames, etc.).  I enjoyed playing with those on the WB150F, but they seem out of place here.  There are a superb number of image adjustments, exposure tweaks, and  controls of a more serious nature as well. When you want to get serious, this camera is ready.  Also, some of  the fun things, like the Panorama mode, do work well if you understand their limitations and keep your expectations reasonable.<br /><br />As expected, the APS-C sensor renders a lot of good image detail. This is the big plus for this camera. I was very pleased with the results under good lighting conditions.  I shoot a lot of landscape and street stuff, and this camera seems well suited for that.  The noise reduction seems to work well up to about 1600 or so (maybe 800 for purists).  Colors are accurate and not over-saturated like on many consumer cameras.  If you like the \\""boost\\"" many cameras give by default, there is a \\""Vivid\\"" mode which will do this for you.  Personally, I prefer the more realistic colors (one of the things I like about Olympus and (most) Panasonics as well). Sharpness is good in JPEGs (I have not shot RAW yet) and tones are nice and smooth (think large expanses of blue sky and clouds).  I'm sure with experience my results will improve over these initial test shots, so that bodes well.  If you like to print big, 16x20, even 20x30 possibly, you will be able to do so, which is very nice.<br /><br />The 20-50mm kit lens is nice enough, but has a very limited range compared to what I am used to.  (I am considering getting the 30mm lens which I think would make a nice compact package for everyday use.)  However, the images look good, sharp, detailed, so I am happy with it.  Video worked well and the zoom worked fine in video mode and was silent.  In casual use, there is no need to switch the dial to video mode, you can just press the Video button on the back and after a slight pause you're in action.  This is nice.  Of course, dialing to full video mode gives you more options.<br /><br />Wifi features worked fine, I was able to easily connect and save pics using the autobackup mode.  Skydrive and others worked fine.  Have not tried the mobile link and remote view finder apps yet. (Update:  I tried these apps out and they worked OK for the most part.  A bit flaky at times.  There is a new \\""Smart Camera app\\"" to replace these, but it only works with the new firmware.  Since I have not yet upgraded the firmware, have not tried it.)  The PC_Autobackup mode works very well for transferring pics and movies to your PC.  It remembers what has been transferred and only transfers new items.  Best to transfer frequently, since slower than reading from a card, but all automatic and very convenient.  [You can also transfer photos to your mobile devices (phone/tablet) using the other apps (Mobile Link/Smart Camera).]<br /><br />Example: You get back from shooting, you activate the PC-Autobackup on the camera (your laptop/PC and network must be on, of course), and the camera will connect and begin transferring your content.  When done the camera will turn-off (unless you press a control button within 30 seconds) and you can set the PC to shutdown as well if you like.  Or you can select the \\""open folder\\"" choice on the PC/notenook popup dialog and view your pics and movies.  All very easy and convenient.<br /><br />There is a \\""Smart Range\\"" feature to extend  dynamic range and preserve highlights.  It seems to work well, but you lose shadow detail. Might want to turn off by default, I think.  (You can also shoot RAW and tweak things  yourself, of course.)<br /><br />JPEGS look very good to me with a lot of detail and sharpness.  So good that I think shooting JEPG only is feasible with the NX1000.  (You can always switch to RAW or RAW+Jpeg when needed, of course.)  I think many will find the Jpegs entirely adequate for most purposes.  (If you shoot a lot at high ISO's you would definitely want to shoot RAW.)  You have a range of aspect ratios including 1:1, 3:2, and 16:9.  This is nice and gives you flexibility in camera versus cropping later.<br /><br />The 8fps burst mode worked very well, though as has been noted everywhere, there is a lag as the camera processes the shots before you can shoot again.  I am a fairly deliberate photographer and don't shoot much action/sports, so the NX1000/1100 is fine for me.  The occasional lags when switching modes and after bursts or RAW shots are not an issue for me, but could be for some.  It's all covered in many of the excellent online review"

1558289,2851296,"product offering within the company specializing in data products and expansion.<br /><br />Which leads me to choosing Sonnett Technologies and their G5 Jive. This company is well known for data products expansion cards like FireWire, USB, SATA and SATA II controller cards as well as corresponding data and power cables that support the Mac. Their image in the Mac community helps make my buying decision easier.<br /><br />I liked the idea of the G5 Jive because the product is a two-piece design versus everyone else's four piece and the G5 Jam's one LARGE cosmetically altering piece. Their idea is one full metal bracket that houses all three hard drives that rests on top of a similar metal plate screwed on the internal floor of the G5. It comes with all the necessary screws to attach the base plate to the G5 and the to the hard drives. The only thing you will be needing is a Philips screw driver and your good to go and connect it to your SATA hard drives and host controller.<br /><br />Furthermore, they created the data and power cables specifically for this expansion option. Which means the proper length of each piece and the proper design - L-shaped SATA data cable connectors for a low profile look and a power cable with three connectors in one simple piece that taps into the socket of the internal DVD drive versus buying three separate power cables that tap into each other and end up bulky and messy in the G5.<br /><br />In addition their manual is straigh-forward and full of pictures to guide you with the very simple installation procedure. You don't even have to read the text they wrote. Just look at the step-by-step pictures and you will know what to do. Bravo on this aspect (although a booklet would have been more impressive).<br /><br />So with all this highlights, why only 3 stars?<br /><br />For one, price. This is certainly a bargain for a majority because it specifically meets the standard option of building an internal SATA RAID. It isn't a good buy for others who are still stuck in the older IDE connection or for other more expensive options of SCSI or Fiber Channel devices. (Although higher end options are not supported with this bracket due to excessive vibration. Besides if you can afford those, it would be better to purchase an external RAID).<br /><br />Second, construction. Build quality is a robust metal piece. It isn't smooth in construction or thick in make. In fact it's the ugliest base plate and bracket I've seen for the beautiful G5.<br /><br />Three stars because there is nothing fancy in the design to highlight the additional internal drives. No Polycarbonate, PolyAcetal or Aluminum material here. Just your basic metal bracket with a very simple design that serves its purpose. No questions asked.<br /><br />And for the suggested retail price of USD99.00, it may turn most of the people away from the product. But at Amazon you can buy it for less with free"

1633172,377355,"product offers only the following: a 2 3/4\\"" half-serrated lockback blade; a tiny pair of spring-loaded pliers; a slot for a tiny screwdriver with a tiny regular and Philips-head bit; and another exactly the same flat/Philips bit.<br /><br />Overall, the feel of the closed product is good, a little bit of heft, but not too heavy.  The pocket clip is good and tight, and it feels good in the pocket.  I note the three screws affixing the clip to the tool are necessarily bunched together in one spot, and there is a 3/8\\"" tongue over the knife's lockback spring.  Having carried many lockbacks over the years, I suspect that long-term use will loosen these bunched-up screws.<br /><br />The knife is fine, and opens easily with one hand.  There is no thumb stud, but a thumb hole instead.  A one-hand close is possible, but only if finishing the close against another surface.  The blade is substantial, a full 1/16\\"" wide along its back.  There is no secondary lock for the blade (as you'll find in most CRKT knives, and some others).<br /><br />Opening the tool exposes the pliers.  There is no locking mechanism to prevent the tool from opening if the knife blade is open.  The pliers are pretty dinky, all of 1/16\\"" wide at the tip and 3/16\\"" wide at the very back, 15/16\\"" deep until you reach the wire cutter.  The wire cutter itself is also tiny, all of 3/16\\"" deep.  The pliers are spring-loaded, with an open spring making an audible \\""squink\\"" as you work the pliers.  The spring is secured at one end, and moves free"

1651815,836959,"unit got this way before proceeding.<br /><br /> The battery is going to be the square piece covered in a foil type pouch cover (you may want to search online for the battery first to get an actual visual) with a red and black wire connecting it to the motherboard. This is located on the front side of the unit, were the led light indicator is located. It is in the middle square ring casing that houses the board between the motherboard and front side casing. Both the front and back external casing, will need to be separated from the rest of the assembly into two parts front and back to gain access to the battery. Make sure you do not take apart the wings that hold the gps transmitted flex strips as they are attached by tack soldering,  and the left over gray internal square plastic ring housing, that holds the board and guts of the system apart. Again do not separate the wing structure casing, the board casing and board as these area are attached to one another with the flex/foil strips. The only parts I would take off of the assembled would be  the front and back external casing, and the other parts can be lifted or manipulated enough to give you ample room in order to disconnect and remove the battery from the board assembly.<br /><br />Once open be careful as the copper flex ships can tear off the unit easily.  The motherboard is held in by 4 small plastic gray clips. Carefully, carefully, unclip by gently pushing down and out wards on all four corners.  After you do so, pushed aside in order to pop out the mother board. Be careful not to tear, bend or manipulate the copper flex strips attached to the various casings and parts as listed above.<br /><br />The next step is to disconnect the power plug that goes from the battery to the board. You will notice a twisted black and red wire. One end attaches to the battery and the other attached from the battery to the motherboard by a small white male to female clip. The board has the male connection and the battery has the female connection. Squeeze the white clips gently to release the male and female clips. Carefully slip the outside cover off if you need to get better access to the battery line. Note your battery specifications and size then order the battery off of your details but feel free"

1696401,2456046,"unit is sent to take in a crime lord who runs his own apartment building, and the cops, led by star Iko Uwais, have to fight the buildings' criminal occupants floor-by-floor. Now, aside from this being a great action film, this unfortunately led to unfair and inaccurate comparisons to the equally good DREDD, which had a similar plot but was actually filmed before this film began production and only garnered cries of &#34;rip-off&#34; since it was released after this film. But that's beside the point. THE RAID: REDEMPTION is still a genius work of action cinema.<br /><br />Evans, however, wasn't satisfied with this. He wanted to make a second film that topped the first one, taking it out of the claustrophobic apartments and putting it in a number of different settings, and this led to THE RAID 2: BERANDAL (the subtitle being cut for the American cut), which not only tops the original in scope, but also in story and sheer brutality. Once again, we follow Rama (Uwais), as the film opens almost immediately after the ending of the first film, as he is enlisted by a secretive division within the police force to help root out even more corruption within the police department. His assignment is to be placed in prison to gain the trust of the son of one of the city's most ruthless crime lords, so that upon his release, he can lead the police to the most corrupt of the police force. If Rama doesn't do this, it puts his family in danger. He reluctantly agrees, and suddenly, he's in prison. Once he does gain the confidence of the son, after saving his life, he finds himself exactly where he's supposed to be, but not knowing who to trust. And as the tension mounts, Rama must take it upon himself to punish the criminals that the police won't touch.<br /><br />Without a doubt, THE RAID 2 is the most bone-crushing, insanely and hilariously brutal, and masterfully executed martial arts action film in years. Each sequence tops the one previous. From the opening fight in the prison bathroom to the subsequent fight in the mud-caked prison yard to a single assassin's nightclub fight against increasingly impossible odds to an insane car chase sequence leading to the ultimate showdown in the main villain's lair... it just keeps getting more and more intense, more and more bloody and more and more over-the-top. Uwais proves himself once again as an incredibly capable leading man as well as a genius fight choreographer. It's a long film, but Evans, as writer/editor/director, doesn't waste a frame. Some of the shots of this film are as beautiful and stunning as anything you'd see from many of his current peers. The film also gives a powerful sense of drama mixed in with the action.<br /><br />I would say that the only flaw of this film is that there isn't much humor in the dialogue, but the humor actually comes out of the sheer audacity of the fight scenes. There are moments where your jaw will drop to the floor from the sheer shock of what you're watching. For example, in the car chase, a motorcyclist assassin comes up against one of the anti-heroes of the film, and the anti-hero grabs his arm, sticks a fully automatic machine pistol against his helmet, and practically empties the clip into the cyclist's face. Now, if that's a moment that you might think is just too brutal, then this is CLEARLY not a good pick for you. Personally, I laughed hysterically at the sheer ludicrous nature of a moment like that. The whole film exists in a reality that is suited to the film's style and not in a &#34;realistic&#34; setting, giving the film a almost dreamlike quality that is breathtaking to behold.<br /><br />Now, if there's a cut of this film that exists that is different than what I saw that is &#34;uncut&#34;, I'd really like to see exactlyhow deep the cuts were and why so many have given the release of this film in this form such a negative review"

1732645,2360943,"product gets noticed. Science Fiction seems to be the vehicle of choice for this type of advertising. In films like \\""I, Robot\\"" and \\""The Island\\"", the filmmakers have taken already recognizable brands or concepts for future products and use them as \\""The Future\\"" in their films. Because Cadillac allowed the use of their concept cars, the camera seems obligated to linger on the logo on each cars grill, lovingly, for long periods of time. A `futuristic' bottle of Michelob Light sits in front of Steve Buscemi's character. They need to leave the bar immediately, but he still has time to pick up the bottle, logo front and center, take a drink, and put the bottle back on the bar, the camera holding on the bottle after Buscemi has left. Enough with the productplacements already.<br /><br />This bit of the story fills the first 45 minutes or so. Then Bay seems to get bored. The second part of the film becomes a more traditional action film. Lincoln and Jordan are chased through one situation after another. As this is a Michael Bay film, the chase scenes are big, loud and impressive, but they just don't fit with the first half of the film. First of all, the two characters are so naïve and childlike, how are they able to escape a band of hired mercenaries lead by Djimon Hounsou for so long? Lincoln and Jordan know nothing beyond the containment facility, yet they are able to allude this team of men in helicopters, motorcycles and souped up Cadillacs for almost an hour of screen time. How exactly do they know that the information booths emblazoned with the MSN logos will be able to help them? Or that they should avoid the many MTA trains gliding through the sky? How much did the MTA pay for that piece of fiction? As impressive as the action scenes are, they just don't work with the rest of the film.<br /><br />At about two hours and fifteen minutes, the film is way too long. The first part is good, but at 45 minutes, it seems like a major portion of the film. When the chase begins and it then lasts for over an hour, you start squirming in your seats. Alarmingly, Bay even stops the chase at one point for Johansson to watch her own Calvin Klein Perfume commercial in a shop window. Huh?<br /><br />Both of the lead actors are acceptable, but I expect so much more from both. McGregor has been in a series of very good independent and foreign films. He is a very good actor and in \\""The Island\\"", he manages to convey Lincoln's naivet&eacute; and curiosity well. What he doesn't manage to do is convince us that he can suddenly outwit a band of mercenaries chasing him. As Jordan, Scarlett Johansson takes a real step back. This is the type of role Jessica Biel would be good at. Standing around, looking good, like eye candy. In the film, someone exposes the two to Maxim magazine. Didn't Johansson do a spread for Maxim at one point? Basically, she acts like a living spread for Maxim throughout the entire film. She looks good standing next to McGregor's character and acts dumb throughout.<br /><br />The first part of the film shows that Bay can make a film about characters, with a story, and create a definite sense of time and place. Now, he simply has to stop second-guessing himself and allow this creative side to take over. Mr. Bay, you don't need to resort to elaborate free"
1734860,3417483,"unit gets to the main page quick at startup, I've noticed the unit is sluggish right at first and takes a couple of seconds to go from one thing to another.  Compared to a Garmin, the TomTom is slower.  However, the TomTom does calculate routes very quickly with a great summary of the route before it starts routing.<br />- When you miss a turn, you don't hear anything.  It just reroutes.  I personally like to know I hosed up the turn, but that's me.  The reroute is very quick though.<br />- Was hoping that with Bluetooth, I would be able to sync POIs with other TomToms, but so far I have yet to see that option.<br /><br />Overall, solid GPS with tons of features, but not without it's compromises.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a fully featured GPS, but if technology is daunting to you and you just want to get from point A to point B choose a Garmin.  This TomTom is for the person who not only want to get to a destination, but want's to be \\""plugged\\"" in to all what's going on and enjoys getting the data that this GPS offers.  It's a very good GPS with a great amount of information provided to the user.  If that sounds like something you like, this GPS is for you.ough I was in a parking lot??  On a main road, no prob.<br />- MyTomTom is VERY limiting.  You can upload the latest maps/updates, but at the time of this review"

1735589,553453,"unit gives you a good real-world determination of what a cable run is good for - but doesn't quite fulfill full ISO and TSA certification requirements contractors require to fulfill contract requirements.  Its weakness is results entry and advanced network mapping - making this best suited for the network admin or network installer working on discrete runs or spot jobs (i.e. you can't use this to certify and report a big thousand port installation - but for day to day network run/patch troubleshoots, diags, and installs it's the BEST).  The Service kit includes the CableIQ and 3 great accessories - a six pack of remote identifying transponders, the Intellitone 100 probe, and the LinkRunner Pro network diag tool.<br /><br />The CableIQ unit is compact and quick and easy to use and very very powerful.  If you select \\""Discover\\"" it will immediately tell you length and topology of the wire you're plugged into.  It will tell you if it's live ethernet (and what speed), or if it's POE, or telephone.  Telephone ring current and POE can give you a nasty shock, so it's great to know when a wire you're about to work on has live current.  The IQ will warn you with a lightning bolt symbol as well as exact ID.  When terminating or troubleshooting it will tell you if there's a short or an open - and on which wires and how far down the wire.  Set it to \\""AutoTest\\"" and it will qualify - i.e. tell you what uses the cable run will work for (i.e. will it work for POE, Gigabit, VOIP, or only 100baseT?)  AutoTest requires a transponder at the far end of the run.  The Service kit includes six remote identifiers which - along with the CableIQ's included transponder allows you to rapidly test and qualify up to 7 runs in one pass without having to go to the other end to move the transponder.  This is great for labeling and identifying ports, as well as telling you if that patch or termination is good - or has to be reterminated.<br /><br />The weak link is the \\""Results\\"" setting - which allows you to save your test results - but (as is typical in this class of device) labeling your results requires a lot of fiddling with the navigation buttons to input text.  The alternative is to have a much larger unit with a full keyboard.  I'll take the compact unit and note the results another way rather than suffer through this kind of entry.  If you must provide electronic records and label a lot of results you should get a bigger unit with better text entry.  You can download your test results to a PC via the USB port BTW.<br /><br />The CableIQ is used to tone and find runs by setting it on \\""Tone\\"" and then using the Intellitone 100 probe to seek.  You can use up to 4 different tones (2 normal, and 2 variable) so you can several teams working at the same time .  The probe has two different levels of sensitivity so you can set it to max sensitivity to find which bundle has your wire, then set it to low sensitivity to find exactly which one of those wires in the bundle is yours.  The tip of the probe fits into patch panels just fine.  Toning out runs is fine - but the CableIQ shuts off after 15 minutes to save the battery, which can be inconvenient at times - just FYI.  Also this tone rig doesn't have a convenient way to work with 110 or 66 punchdown blocks.  You can always craft a test wire that has RJ45 at one end and alligator clips at the other (or bare wire to manually punch in) - but that's not included and isn't in this device's core competency.<br /><br />The LinkRunner is actually a whole other tester with some overlapping features - such as POE voltage detection, wiremap, and link speed detection.  It also add a whole other level of network awareness - it helps you identify which switch port you're connected to and does network pinging, DHCP, verify 802.1x.<br /><br />Thewhole kit is very synergistic and makes you ready for whatever network data wire work that comes your way (except for fiber channel, of course) - as long as the wire is terminated with RJ45/11 or F coax.  Since - there's no alligator clips or 66/110 block attachments it's not the tool for old fashioned telco punchdown testing"

1741432,613428,"product offering in the United States, availability and cost of replacement parts in the future is unknown.<br /><br />Because we use our grill twice daily, we have had to, in the past, make claims undera grill's warranty.  Based on all factors the “Cadac 98700-33-01 Stratos 3-Burner Stainless Steel 39,000 BTU Gas Grill” is a 4-star product.  Were the warranty periods increased to those of Weber products, the “Cadac Stratos” would have received 5 stars.<br /><br />SHIPPING and DELIVERY NOTE: UPS delivered my grill both upside down and to the wrong address.  Damage to the grill was primarily cosmetic; my spouse was able to straighten the pieces that were slightly bent.  Had it not been for the excellent packing job by Amazon – boxing the box, lots of air cushions, and lots of cardboard corners to secure the grill packaging – it is likely the grill would have been more seriously damaged.

1777102,2377683,"product gives very good results, feels and smells pleasant, makes the skin look smooth and soft.  However, there are perhaps too many ingredients here, some of them duplicating the use of others (e.g., phenoxyethanol and potassium sorbate both functioning as preservatives), and others are perhaps in such small quantities per application that their benefits to your skin might be minimal.<br /><br />The main problem, IMO, would be for users with sensitive skin, since several of the above ingredients can be skin irritants.  If what you're looking for isjust a hyaluronic acid serum, try one of the HA serums with only 3 ingredients:  water, hyaluronic acid and a preservative.<br /><br />(This product was supplied by Celeste LeBeau for a fair and impartial review"

Videographers might note that there is an external mike that works with the hotshoe and uses no cables at all, nice!<br /><br />In general, I find the NX1000/1100 easy to use, the manual focus works well, the Smart mode seems to do fairly well, there are a great many scene modes and other (somewhat gimmicky) features (Magic filters/frames, etc.).  I enjoyed playing with those on the WB150F, but they seem out of place here.  There are a superb number of image adjustments, exposure tweaks, and  controls of a more serious nature as well. When you want to get serious, this camera is ready.  Also, some of  the fun things, like the Panorama mode, do work well if you understand their limitations and keep your expectations reasonable.<br /><br />As expected, the APS-C sensor renders a lot of good image detail. This is the big plus for this camera. I was very pleased with the results under good lighting conditions.  I shoot a lot of landscape and street stuff, and this camera seems well suited for that.  The noise reduction seems to work well up to about 1600 or so (maybe 800 for purists).  Colors are accurate and not over-saturated like on many consumer cameras.  If you like the &#34;boost&#34; many cameras give by default, there is a &#34;Vivid&#34; mode which will do this for you.  Personally, I prefer the more realistic colors (one of the things I like about Olympus and (most) Panasonics as well). Sharpness is good in JPEGs (I have not shot RAW yet) and tones are nice and smooth (think large expanses of blue sky and clouds).  I'm sure with experience my results will improve over these initial test shots, so that bodes well.  If you like to print big, say 16x20, you will be able to do so, which is very nice.<br /><br />The 20-50mm kit lens is nice enough, but has a very limited range compared to what I am used to.  (I am considering getting the 30mm lens which I think would make a nice compact package for everyday use.)  However, the images look good, sharp, detailed, so I am happy with it.  Video worked well and the zoom worked fine in video mode and was silent.  In casual use, there is no need to switch the dial to video mode, you can just press the Video button on the back and after a slight pause you're in action.  This is nice.  Of course, dialing to full video mode gives you more options.<br /><br />Wifi features worked fine, I was able to easily connect and save pics using the autobackup mode.  Skydrive and others worked fine.  Have not tried the mobile link and remote view finder apps yet. (Update:  I tried these apps out and they worked OK for the most part.  A bit flaky at times.  There is a new &#34;Smart Camera app&#34; to replace these, but it only works with the new firmware.  Since I have not yet upgraded the firmware, have not tried it.)  The PC_Autobackup mode works very well for transferring pics and movies to your PC.  It remembers what has been transferred and only transfers new items.  Best to transfer frequently, since slower than reading from a card, but all automatic and very convenient.  [You can also transfer photos to your mobile devices (phone/tablet) using the other apps (Mobile Link/Smart Camera).]<br /><br />Example: You get back from shooting, you activate the PC-Autobackup on the camera (your laptop/PC and network must be on, of course), and the camera will connect and begin transferring your content.  When done the camera will turn-off (unless you press a control button within 30 seconds) and you can set the PC to shutdown as well if you like.  Or you can select the &#34;open folder&#34; choice on the PC/notenook popup dialog and view your pics and movies.  All very easy and convenient.<br /><br />There is a &#34;Smart Range&#34; feature to extend  dynamic range and preserve highlights.  It seems to work well, but you lose shadow detail. Might want to turn off by default, I think.  (You can also shoot RAW and tweak things  yourself, of course.)<br /><br />JPEGS look very good to me with a lot of detail and sharpness.  So good that I think shooting JEPG only is feasible with the NX1000.  (You can always switch to RAW or RAW+Jpeg when needed, of course.)  I think many will find the Jpegs entirely adequate for most purposes.  (If you shoot a lot at high ISO's you would definitely want to shoot RAW.)  You have a range of aspect ratios including 1:1, 3:2, and 16:9.  This is nice and gives you flexibility in camera versus cropping later.<br /><br />The 8fps burst mode worked very well, though as has been noted everywhere, there isa lag as the camera processes the shots before you can shoot again.  I am a fairly deliberate photographer and don't shoot much action/sports, so the NX1000/1100 is fine for me.  The occasional lags when switching modes and after bursts or RAW shots are not an issue for me, but could be for some.  It's all covered in many of the excellent online review"

I didn't like the idea of killing the mice, so I tried live traps, repellent, spin traps, etc, and found that classic snap traps are the most effective. But they can be messy and hurt when you or your curious dog steps on them. I liked these Tomcat traps because they are reusable and safer for humans and pets. I smear in the tiniest bit of peanut butter for bait and HAVE NEVER HAD THE BAIT TAKEN WITHOUT CATCHING A MOUSE... After catching 5 or 6 in a week and mouse activity subsided, I left the traps out for months with no bait taken, and no evidence of mice in my kitchen. When they came back in the spring, the old peanut butter still worked. I can't explain the video review"

Does anyone quality control anymore?  Just got my order on time and functional.  I run windows 7 64 bit and purchased this item for use with skype and everything works well.

1834981,1328604,"unit getting a dozen different directions to their destination by Parisians; SS men casually looking through Von Choltitz's papers out of force of habit; and the general suddenly finding himself alone in a restaurant as the bells of Paris ring out for the first time in four years to proclaim the Allies' arrival.      The Americans don't fare as well, all-too obviously being there simply for marquee value (the prominently billed George Chakhiris is in it for less than 30 seconds!), although Anthony Perkins' soldier acting more like a tourist is at least memorable, while most of the German regulars - Gunther Meisner, Karl-Otto Alberty, Wolfgang Preiss, Hannes Messemer - are pretty much stuck in their usual bad/good German roles from every other war movie they ever made (that said, it's a surprise Anton Diffring didn't get an invite as well!). In many ways the two real stars of the film are the city of Paris and Maurice Jarre's excellent score, the film's only real constant factors as the stars come and go and events move forward. For the most part the film avoids the tourist shots with a great use of locations, giving a sense of a place where people actually live and die, while Jarre's score manages to counterpoint a militant piano-led theme for the Nazi Occupation with an increasingly stirring resistance theme that constantly runs underneath it, gradually working its way out of hiding and constantly gaining ascendancy before finally flowering into a vivid and triumphant waltz for the Liberation.      A somewhat ill-fated production - producer Paul Graetz died of a heart attack during filming - it was a huge but much-criticized success in France but a conspicuous box-office failure everywhere else, withParamount swearing off the epic genre for decades to come and Rene Clement's career never really recovering: his last major film, he wouldn't work again for another three years and only made four more films. Best remembered today for Plein Soleil/Purple Noon, Clement was a logical choice for the film, having had earlier had much success with previous WW2 films La Bataille du Rail, about the French resistance on the railway network, and the Oscar-winning Jeux Interdit/Forbidden Games, and his direction is for the most part superb, be it the control of a chillingly formal tracking shot along a railway platform casually revealing and passing a dead body or the edgy hand-held work during some of the makeshift street fights. Although the decision to film in black and white which would hurt the film so much at the box-office and on television was reputedly forced on the film by the French government's refusal to allow the film to fly red and black Nazi flags over the city (grey and black, however, were permitted), it works to the film's advantage, not only allowing it to incorporate genuine archive footage a little more skilfully than is the norm but also gives it a more verite feel thanks to Marcel Grignon's naturalistic photography. If at times this feels less like the classic it could have been and more like the best film that could be made under the political and financial circumstances, it's still an impressive and occasionally compelling recreation of a unique moment in history that deserves to be at least a little better known and better regarded than it is.      Unfortunately Paramount's DVD is a bit ill-starred itself. Although several behind the scenes documentaries and trailers exist, the fact that the DVD is extras-free"

1852932,498438,"product offers a quality built, high performance image processor which contributes to crispy sharp playback especially with panning moving subjects, a newly developed ZEISS Vario-Sonnar (pro level) lens for realistic colors, very quiet and responsive 10X optical zoom (20x in AVCHD mode) and 5.1 surround audio recording for great all around sound; are just a few highlights that I am impressed with.  Did I also mention this camcorder has a pretty long battery life which is a pleasant surprise? When you do have this camcorder in your possession, you will note a caution in the owner’s manual about using an approved Sony battery specific for this model.  It records in 4K.  Need I say more?  One does not need a 4K TV to see the beauty of the recorded footage.  My initial resolution settings was XAVC S HD 1920 x 1020 before I decided to record everything at 4K after I noticed it was not eating the capacity of my SDXC cards.  On my 80” TV, any low quality video recording will be quickly apparent on my TV.  The clarity of the output through the mini HDMI output jack at 1920 x 1020 (cable not supplied); is beyond amazing and has impressed my family and neighbors with a critical eye. It records 30p and 24p movies in 4K and a higher 60p (+ 30p and 24p) in Full HD 1080.  All of my night time and indoor footage was done with a high degree of sharpness and clarity.  Maybe it is time to purchase my first Sony 4K curved TV to pair this sweet camcorder. :-)  Optical image stabilization is an important and mandatory feature in any modern camera and camcorder.  Unless one loves to see shakes and burry footage during a slow walk or tracking a fast moving object like a tennis match. With different technologies that exists, this Sony FDRAX33 Handycam has one of the best stabilization systems out there.  It offers a very reliable and advanced solution called BOSS which stands for Balanced Optical SteadyShot which have its entire lens system suspended in its chassis, giving the illusion of floating. Since I don’t have a very steady hand especially when I myself is on the move together with my moving subjects, the BOSS gives me that edge of a blur free"

1891057,3426590,"product gets one star for sooo many reasons. Had NetGear honestly marketed their product I wouldn't have wasted two weeks and multiple hours of set up. I had considered NetGear a good brand name. Not any more. Check below for details of experience.<br /><br />1. Set up instructions are poor. They are bare bones and only are adequate if everything is working fine and your wireless is  compatible with this unit. No troubleshooting tips provided. No settings listed that you should use on your wireless. Setup may not proceed as stated in manual. Last page on web site asked for login. Log in for what? Tried my wireless which didn't work then tried \\""admin\\"" and \\""password\\"". Then it worked.<br /><br />2. Support is poor. Wait time to speak with representative is long. First rep was difficult to understand. At no time did either rep ever question me about my wireless settings which are very important. Both claimed my extender should work when we were done but it didn't. After setting up a replacement unit which only worked sporadically I searched NetGear website and discovered it was incompatible with my wireless. So why isn't that stated up front and why didn't support ever check?<br /><br />3. The first extender I bought did not work reliably. During set up it would connect and then disconnect from my computer. The second did not work either until I pressed the reset button for 15 seconds (no troubleshooting in instructions so you need to know that on your own). Then the setup went as explained in manual except the last page. The last page of setup wanted an unexpected log in  (not covered in instructions)with no explanation as to what I was logging into.<br /><br />Like everyone I have bought products that either did not work as advertised or were \\""cheap\\"". I've also bought products that were defective and needed to be exchanged. However, in this case I had a combination of poor phone support, inadequate instructions and a bad unit.

1947507,2326798,"unit gets hot is 60 or less seconds.  It collapses so if you want to keep it out of sight.  The only suggestions I would make is either make the cord retractable or put two guides to wrap the cord around because that is probably the only irritating thing about this machine (the cord kind of hangs).  It is a great machine, if you hate ironing, this is definitely the route you want to take.  My old steamer finally died which is why I replaced it with this unit.  I panicked when the old one died because that meant I would have to iron...thankfully that I didn't need to iron anything before this unit showed up.  Steaming makes keeping clothes wrinkle-free"

1958589,399735,"unit gets hot while recording; but as long as it doesn't do any damage or cause a breakdown, I guess that's just the way it is.  A Gopro will not allow itself to overheat; it will shut down automatically if it gets too hot.<br /><br />When you open up your DCIM folder after recording, you may notice several blank-icon files (type LRV & THM) scattered among your video/picture files.  Some computer people call these \\""mouse droppings.\\""  The LRV files can be changed to MP4 and are functional as a mini clip.  This is useful for efficient editing projects on slower computers.  After setting up your edit, you then replace the LRV with your original HD file.  The THM files can be changed to JPG and serve as thumbnails to your photographs. But I just delete all the droppings.  I don't fully understand how to exploit them, and they only show up once in a while.<br /><br />The greatest improvement over the Hero 2 is the new video options available.  The 1080p/60fps is my favorite setting.  This feature alone is the reason I bought the H3B.  The Hero 2 would only shoot 30FPS on 1080.  And to my delight, once I selected 1080/60 on my H3B, I found that I can then adjust the FOV within that setting.  On the hero 2, your FOV options were very limited depending on your resolution setting.  The H3B gives incredible free"

If it is a thermal trip, then it may have shut down eventually, but it stayed active during my 15 min test.<br /><br />It does not come with a cord, but I don't consider that to be any more negative than positive since: most electronic devices come with cords so I don't need another one; I don't like paying for a cord I don't need; and a cord would limit the function to devices that can use that cord.

1963104,1742521,"unit offers a less than faithful amplification of the sound offered by the device. While some of the straight audio tracks (acoustic-heavy rock) had a little muddiness, the stream from HBO Go sounded clean and big, and the YouTube music video sounded rich and strong. But bass dominates everything. Someone wanting portable sound with a powerful bass boost is going to enjoy this unit, because it will deliver the oomph desired, but vocals and guitars suffer.<br /><br />This unit is intended to be on the go. It has an aluminum casing, and the speakers are covered by a heavy metal mesh that straddles the top of the body's casing. There are no intrusive knobs--nothing to get caught on an edge.<br /><br />This unit offers power, portability, toughness, and, for the most part, ease of use. It is meant for fun on the go, and pop and dance lovers will have a good time with it, and gamers can take it outside and loud. If that's what you're looking for, this unit is recommended, with the caveat that one may have to cope with some connectivity issues with some devices.limited documentation in the unit's package does not explain how to remedy this situation; should I discover the solution, I will revise this review"

1966128,1140031,"unit provides an estimated time of arrival, which does update.  So, if you get stuck in traffic it affects the arrival time.  Magellan also tracks your average driving speed.  Both units offer spoken directions.  This is both good and bad.  It's good because the unit tells you to keep right or left when exiting off a ramp or highway that splits into two directions. It tells you when you're approaching your turn and when you've reached your destination.  However, it is extremely annoying when traveling on a highway with local and express lanes.  I-270 in Maryland does this and the unit is constantly telling us to keep right, or left (with no rhyme or reason) in and out of the local lanes!  It's also annoying while driving on long highways like 95 as it keeps reminding you to remain on the current road and not get off.  We mute it while on these roads.  However, if you have no clue at all where you are going, this is a helpful feature.  I found the advance notice justa bout right.  The unit tells you your turn is coming up in about half a mile (sometimes greater notice if you're ona  highway) and then chimes when you've come upon the turn.  The unit also displays what road you are on, and what the next road is supposed to be.  Another plus is if the Magellan loses satellite signal (such as in a tunnel), it displays a list of all your upcoming turns/roads per the route it calculated.  While this isn't as good as the turn by turn directions, it was a nice back-up.  The Magellan offers four choices of \\""chimes\\"" to notify you of your next action (turn, exit, keep right, etc.).  They range in volume and annoyance depending on what you prefer.<br /><br />The points of interest is a nice feature.  We tested it locally by searching for a restaurant.  It displayed all the local choices, from closest to farthest, fast food to sit down.  We chose McDonalds and it got us there exactly as we would normally go - the quickest route.  It allows you to search by coffee, restaurant, gas station, etc.  Though this feature wasn't a priority for us, it is nice to have.  I once drove through Arkansas, and would have loved to have had this then.  We never did find a place to eat, and ending up waiting until we passed into Tennessee!<br /><br />Other review"

1981589,457731,"product was offered as a Lightning Deal from Amazon, I decided to take a chance on it. I was, however, very skeptical. How could something so simple produce great tasting Indian food at home? Well, I am skeptical no longer. I made this for the first time last night and was amazed at how easy it was. All you do is put your raw chicken pieces in a pot with some water, butter, and this product. Then you cook it for about 25 minutes. That's it. One pot and less than a half hour of cooking time. And let me tell you: While the taste of the finished product might not be exactly the same as that found in an authentic Indian restaurant, it's darn close. So close, in fact, that I'd be willing to bet that a lot of people couldn't tell the difference. I can't recommend this product any more highly. It will definitely satisfy my cravings for Indian food going forward! And you can bet that I'll be trying other Kitchens of India products soon!

3533,37111,"receive this item from Gillette as part of a test program, but my review"
3549,487059,"got the unit thru my router and can see the cameras on Google Chrome and Firefox. Also, after setting up a user account on Q-SEE website, I was able to see the cameras on my iPhone. The registration is quick and painless. Very pleased here!  This is a robust system with a USB port to backup history. Very smart. This unit also has a sound option which is very nice. I have run the mike to the front porch. Some things make this a rather simple setup. First assign the unit a fixed IP address. It does not matter that the cameras are on a 10.10.xx.xx sub-net. Then follow the instructions to allow port 85 and 37777 to pass thru your router. You do not have to do anything to your cable modem. I have the latest Motorola unit and it really is just a dumb box for this application. Be sure to enter the 192.168.1.1xx:85 in your browser and it should pull up your Q-SEE remote page and let you log in. Uninstall  the PSS software. You do not need it unless you are an IT or Security professional or just like to tinker. I had an electrician run my cables. I ran two Ethernet cable to each camera. One as a spare. My experience is that sometimes these cables are bad and it is not the connectors. The cameras produce a clear black and white image in the dark. I was surprised by this. The color is very nice with the lights on or during the day. Camera placement is important. I put two in front of my garage. We have a lot of thefts in Florida by folks leaving the garage open and folks dropping in to take their stuff.  Enjoy your system.<br /><br />Addendum to previous review"

5544,2178661,"receive this product, you will need to charge it for a solid 18 hours per the instructions.  So if you are thinking of opening this Christmas morning or at a birthday party etc, you will have some very frustrated kids as the manual warns that using it prior to this initial charge will potentially damage the battery.<br /><br />Now that's out of the way, I spent about 2 hours assembling it and the directions for the most part are well-written.  There are 38 steps with black and white illustrations - very helpful.  There were a few frustrating moments for me.  A few steps where I would add some extra tips are:<br /><br />Step #5 -- Don't try to put the steering wheel cap on the wheels.  I wasted a couple of minutes trying to figure out why it wouldn't snap on the wheel.<br /><br />Step #7/8 -- The illustration in #6 is a bit off - when the right front axle is pulled forward, the left front axle is NOT perpendicular to the vehicle.  This step was rather frustrating, but pull the axle all the way forward and then put the screw in the hole and turn it with some force.<br /><br />Step #17 - this was by far the worst step for me.  I was using the wrong fenders (the front instead of the rear and the photo of the seat seems backwards.  I still can't figure out that illustration but once I had the correct fenders things made more sense and I was able to complete this step.<br /><br />Step #20 - acorn nuts.  To this day I have no idea why they have you put two screws in these holes and put acorn nuts on the back.  They don't seem to serve any purpose.<br /><br />The other assembly tip I would add is make sure you put this together on old towels.  This product scratches extremely easily.  Beyond easily.<br /><br />Overall, assembly was OK and the vehicle looks great. It has good speed and power for a toy and is a lot of fun for the kids.  I do wish the tires were rubber instead of plastic, though... they make a lot of noise and will not wear well on cement.<br /><br />Another tip:  See page 24 (sort of hidden in the back) to read about the screw you remove from the gear shift that doubles the speed from 2.5 to 5 mph.  I'm guessing a lot of people miss that as it is tucked away.<br /><br />My nephew and nieces had a great time on this... they were aged 7 to 11, and we left it on the &#34;slow&#34; speed (there's a screw you remove to enable 5 mph vs 2.5 mph) the whole time.  They all LOVED driving this car around... very maneuverable and handled bumps and even small hills well.  I do wish the tires were rubber.  Easy to work the accelerator and even their dad (an adult) got in and took it for a brief spin, so it has a motor that will handle 150 pounds or so.  We had a really fun afternoon playing with it and the battery lasted the whole afternoon of play.<br /><br />Overall, another quality toy from Fisher Price and one that your kids will love.<br /><br />Hope this helps and if you have questions including assembly questions feel free"

We got the PC version, hooked an HDMI cable to the TV and routed the sound from the PC to the amplifier to fix the lag on the sound through HDMI.  It is just like playing a video game, except with a real guitar.  My daughter loves getting to play with real music and that some of the songs you can download are ones that a 13 year old is into.

This product is meant to go over your initial moisturizer (I use the Redness Relief Night Cream, even in the daytime, as suggested by the dermatologist).  Dab it on / pat it on, do not rub it on!  Use sparingly, you do not glob it on!  It does not cure the redness but reduces it.  My skin tone appears more even and less red when I use it, and that is the purpose of the product.

23887,3425546,"get the unit in it's box up the 6 steps to the house. Thankfully someone else mentioned they'd unloaded it from the box and transported the pieces to the set up area.<br />Was able to carry all the various handles and bars except the main frame w/ the motor. It's a bugger and weighs a bunch. Mr. Wonderful was able to bring it in and set the machine up for me in under an hour w/ little difficulty.<br />I can't get over how out of shape I really am after several minutes on it. I thought my lower body was in pretty good shape and my legs fairly strong. Boy was I wrong.<br />My thighs are fairly sore after day 3 of using the unit, but getting better and easier to add time to my work out each day.<br />It's great cardio, I'm a heavy smoker and tend to carry my weight waist and up.<br />I really like the different work outs and the machine give little prompts, \\""faster, quicker steps\\"", \\""longer strides\\"", etc.<br />The motivational prompts are nice too. No cheery voice telling you to keep it up, good job etc. Scrolling prompts keep me motivated and remind me to speed up, slow down, etc.<br />The units foot print is larger than my treadmill that folded in half and was pretty small when not in use. The widest part is at the front feet. It's set up in my over crowded bedroom and I've only tried to break a toe on it once in the middle of the night so far. A pillow at that foot reminds me it's there and I stop before I bang into the frame.<br />Forget moving it once it's in place. It does have a handle at the back but it's pretty tough to pick up high enough to use the wheels in front to roll it around. I was able to pick it up but not sure how far I would be able to get it w/o injury to either my back or foot when I dropped it.<br />The cup holder is huge and bright red. It sure doesn't blend in but is certainly big enough for a water bottle, phone, remote etc.<br />I was skeptical about the wee fan. It's set more towards your body than face where I want it but has 3 speeds and does more than I thought it would.<br />Other review"

Preferring Amazon's return policy over my drug store's I ordered this. I'm glad I did. The fibers are easy to apply --just shake 'n go. They even stay in place for days (assuming you don't wash them out). The directions say to spray a little hair spray for added protection, but I only did it for rainy days and I'm not sure I really needed to do that then. I'm trying to get my hair that I somehow lost in droves to come back and I worried about the flakes clogging my roots. I don't have the impression at all that the fibers are doing that.

24544,1104012,"given this product's limitations.<br /><br />Range: Yes range isn't very good if you live in a house. We tend to stay near or in the same room as our sleeping baby so this hasn't been an issue for us. However, this is probably an issue for most families who don't live in either an apartment or condo. If this was a wi-fi device, this wouldn't be a problem.<br /><br />Speakers: When the mat is only powered by four AA's, this is a really dumb feature. I'd rather not have the Safe to Sleep mat run out of power for as long as possible. People can play timed music on almost any other device so this is a dumb feature.<br /><br />[Misc]<br /><br />Buy this from Amazon and you won't have issues with product returns if you're a long time customer.

27949,747419,"receive a unit with a similar zipper problem such as mine.<br /><br />- Once set up, my cats could not figure out how to get in or out of the unit.  One cat kept trying to get in from outside the tent netting.  Once he finally got in he started bouncing off the tent because he was scared of the netting. After a few minutes he calmed down.<br /><br />- My other cats had to be coaxed in and out but once they were in they seemed to enjoy it. It just took about 30 minutes for the cats to get used to it. If I had a yard or patio, I know they would have enjoyed it.<br /><br />- My biggest concern is that it's not easy to get the cats out of the tent especially with the tunnel attached. My four cats were intent on staying in there and two of them were a bit unsure how to get out.  If I were to have set this up outside, I can see where I would have a problem extracting the cats from the Happy Habitat as I'd probably have to climb through the tent hole.  While in my house, I had to manipulate the netting to sort of squeeze them out.<br /><br />If using this outdoors, I recommend supervising the cats. Their nails could rip through the tent if a fight breaks out with multiple cats in an enclosed setting. Also, wild animals can attack them if left unsupervised.<br /><br />Attaching the tunnel itself is a bother and for that reason I recommend this complete compound with reservations. I see that there's an [[ASIN:B002KWHE1E ABO Gear Happy Habitat for Indoor Cats]] (without the tunnel) that is about $24 cheaper. I would recommend that for those who are purchasing this as an outdoor enclosure for their indoor cats without the play element of a tunnel. However, for those who want to add a little bit extra fun to the Happy Habitat, then this is a good purchase. I think the currently listed price of $72.34 is reasonable.  Also, there's no reason the tunnel cannot be used in the house as just a play tunnel and the tent used for outside the house.  I also think this compound could probably be used for small dogs as well.<br /><br />This gets 3.7 stars from me and 4.5 stars from my 4 cats.<br /><br />PS Amazon apparently changed the way images are posted.  I took several pictures with my 4 cats in this compound.  I attached the instructions on  how to view them in the comments section of this review"

The video and manual instructions make it look like a 'piece of cake' to do. Far from it except if your router is the same as the default type in the video or manual. While it took me at least an hour of intensely trying to get to the bottom of the whole thing, I got it to work. Simply, I wanted it to work. If you are not fond of electronics, it could be really frustrating.<br /><br />For me, I had to google the problem I was having because it was not in their FAQs, and luckily there are more than a dozen people asking the same question. I will suggest the manufacturer update it's manual to reflect all issues most people are facing. Their FAQs, video and paper instructions must include other types of routers. Their website forum page is a joke and need modernization. They make too much money to have that kind of antiquated forum page.<br /><br />Anyway, the installation is done and I can now receive full bars in all previously dead zones in my house.

33613,1218629,"got the product, I gave it a test run before actually using it on full head. As I am righty, doing my left side of hair was easy. Bangs was easy too. I can see the volume immediately. But when I was doing my right side of hair section, the spinning rotation got out of hand & the heated part of brush touched my skin just below my ear. It got burned, not really painful but anyone can see the scar. I am not going hold that against the styler as it was my first time with the product & I learned my lesson well.<br /><br />Next day, I washed my hair & according to instruction dried my hair 70-80% ,then put on some heat protectant & sectioned off the hair to dry my hair spin air style(YAY!!). It was quite hot on low setting for me(I don't use high heat on my hair ever & its a start of summer here in India,so pretty hot already). Dried my hair nicely without any trouble from dryer part of the machine. But I can't say the same for rotating part of the machine. It didn't tangle, but spinning used to stop suddenly in between & suddenly it started. At first I thought I am not pressing the spin button properly, but it wasn't that. Spinning stopped whenever it felt like to. Kinda annoying. Otherwise, it was good. But I paid about $69(incl. shipping), so I expected much more better. But at least its not as bad as that Revo styler.<br /><br />Amazon Shipping:<br />When I purchased this product, Amazon said I'll be getting this by 11th April(approximately 1 month after ordering). But it was a pleasant surprise when I got it on 31st March. Thumbs up for that. But I have to say, Amazon packed this in a way too big box. I mean, inside the box it was literally the machine in original packing on one side & some air filled bags on the other side.At least they should have put the machine's original box in the middle & put those air filled bags around for safety of the product.<br /><br />In short:<br /><br />Pros:1.

And I can't say I blame her--it's not anything like a foot massage or anything that feels nice while you are doing it.  I describe the sensation as being similar to when your feet fall asleep and get all tingly (though at the levels I tried, the tingling from your feet actually falling asleep is much more uncomfortable).  My wife described it as feeling like ants are crawling on your feet.  Either way, neither of us liked it.  Not only that, but I had used it for several minutes and it took longer than that for my feet and calves to feel perfectly normal again.<br /><br />Based on this experience, I'm inclined to give the product 1 star.  HOWEVER, in fairness to AccuRelief, I don't think my wife and I are the intended patients for this device.  This isn't intended to treat feet that are sore from standing on them all day.

36302,1866542,got a coupon for this product I thought I'd give it a try. I like the lavender bottle since it matches my bathroom decor. I like how clean my mouth feels after I use it - cleaner than anything else I've ever tried. I'm apparently not allergic to it although it does make my mouth tingle a bit but not a burning sensation. I am allergic to almost every toothpaste I've ever tried but this product did not make my mouth peel or make my gums sore. In fact it pretty much did everything it promised. After a week of use my teeth did look whiter. I only drink one cup of coffee a day so not much to whiten. Now the only things this does that is a bit annoying is that it foams on your tongue. If you are going to buy this product do yourself a favor and get a tongue scraper as well. Once you spit this stuff out and rinse a bit you will need to scrape your tongue to get off all the foam. I think this is just from the hydrogen peroxide. I would not recommend this product for people with sensitive mouths. I take no responsibility for your health if you use this product.

My range extender works best when it is as far away from my main router as possible (on opposite side, second floor of 5,000 sq ft home).<br /><br />2) Connection Dropping: As noted above, the range extender was dropping the connection (and still showing 3 bars!) about 10 times per hour on average.

I definitely made the right choice!<br /><br />Using this steam cleaner can't be easier, once you get all the items out of the box it is only a matter of setting the hose in place, adding some water and the included disinfecting solution (this is an optional step, you will obviously get better results using the solution), waiting for the Steam Ready indicator light to let you know when ready and you're good to go!<br /><br />I can't simply start describing the difference between scrubbing the walls and the floor and using the Hoover Steam Cleaner... abysmal!

The results on floor are also impressive, this got rid of crayola residues left on the floor by my 4 year old!

A LOT more thoughtful.  When I opened the box of the KRUPS EA9000 I was not greeted by a box that looked well planned and capable of protecting this $3,500.00 Barista, I was greeted with one million Styrofoam balls the size of pinheads that had come loose from the packaging and invaded every crevice of the items inside the box.  They were statically charged from all the friction and I am still finding them around my house despite spending 45 minutes cleaning them up and out of the Barista.  So why be so hung up on Styrofoam balls? Because they were inside the machine!  They were in the water tank mechanisms, the seams on every surface, the knock box, the drip trays, the grinder hatch -- EVERYWHERE!  In fact, after my hubby and I made the first latte he tasted it and made a face, pausing to pull these tiny white pellets out of his mouth because they had gotten up into the steamer apparently despite me cleaning the wand before hand.  Who knows if they got up into the tamper and pump, I guess I will find out someday.  It has made me worry that some day this will stop working because a pellet will have found its way into an area that will throw out an error message instead of espresso.<br /><br />DROP DAMAGE WARNING: The plastic strap they provide to lift it out of the box is very slick and promptly slipped the machine out the back of the sling, sending it crashing to the floor!  Thank goodness I have strong arms and caught it and wrestled the 38-pound block onto the counter before it smashed into a$3,500 paperweight. I have a Jura ENA 9 Micro machine that is a lesser machine if comparing features, but at least when it arrived to my house it was dressed in custom pressure molded shipping material and was easily unpacked and on the counter for use in 5 minutes.<br /><br />ESPRESSO DRINKS SPEED:<br />In relation to my Jura machine, it takes 4 times as long to make an espresso drink with the KRUPS machine; in a side-by-side race, I pumped out 3.5 lattes from the Jura in the time it took to make one latte with the KRUPS with equal foam.  The foam wand bogs down the speed considerably.<br /><br />ESPRESSO TEMP & TASTE:<br />The shots come out nice and hot; 184 degrees for loaded beans and 180 for grinds delivered through the by-pass chute.  The taste of the KRUPS shot rated slightly higher than the Jura shot, but the Jura machine I was using was just the entry-level unit with minimal bells and whistles - I expected the KRUPS machine to blow it out of the water due to price and process but it was marginally deeper in flavor and complexity. I can only imagine how good a high-end Jura machine drink would taste.<br /><br />FOAM:<br />The foam from the KRUPS Barista takes a long time to produce vs. the Jura foam process, but is thick and well balanced after you adjust the personal settings. The stock setting on my KRUPS machine was for only four seconds of frothing on the latte and caused me to think that the unit was broken at first since no foam was yielded -- even when using whole milk. I set the personal drinks froth at 30 seconds to achieve the amount of foam you'd expect from a caf&eacute;. The wand is a fun looking gadget but not superior to the Jura process IMO.  With the KRUPS, you have to fill each cup with the milk you want and then go through 3-4 screens to get the drink started. Then the frothing wand is soaped and rinsed after each drink.  With the Jura you have an exterior milk container that is syphoned into the machine for instant frothing.  If your household uses a bunch of different milks, the KRUPS process may be an asset. If you have 6 guests all wanting the same milk lattes or cappuccinos, then the Jura is the clear winner.<br /><br />WASTE WATER:<br />As other review"

It is possible that Amazon sources these discs from different companies at different times. This might also explain the constant crazy fluctuation of the price for these discs. So some batches are obviously good, while others... not so much. So here is my advice. Like I said before, these discs are super cheap.

Once activated on the network, I proceeded to do a Blackberry Enterprise Server activation for corporate email, etc.  I have since been using it, rather heavily, for email, twitter, and even streaming financial data.  Battery loss of approximately 20% after almost 11.5 hours of moderate/heavy usage to me is phenomenal, but, as I said time will tell this tale and I will post updates about it when I can.<br /><br />Keyboard: The Tour has a similar keyboard to the bold, except it seems to me that the keys are raised a bit more.  The little addition of height allows for a better feel of the keys thus making typing a breeze.  I was not a huge fan of the Bold keyboard but I do love the Curve II keyboard and now it would seem that this new style keyboard may just be the winner of the bunch.  I am appreciative of the fact that Verizon left the number keys colored RED which AT&T always wants to re-color to white.  The red actually provides for some contrast and makes using the device a bit more pleasurable.<br /><br />Screen: The screen on the Tour is the same beautiful half VGA (480x360) screen found on the 8900 (Curve II).  It is bright, sharp, and displays 65,000 colors.  Not much more can be said...but it comes close to perfect for the Blackberries.<br /><br />Camera: Again the same as the 8900, a 3.2mp auto focus camera with image stabilization and video capturing abilities.  Yes, there is a flash also for those dark moments.<br /><br />Charging: As with every new cellular device, this has a Micro USB port positioned on its right side...which is a little bit of a bad placement job as it was on the 8900, but, not a deal breaker.  My only gripe here is that I tend to want to use Blackberry Docks and with all of these different devices you must acquire a different dock. #FAIL on the dock not being universal...but accessories make these guys big money and so they do what they must.<br /><br />Sound: The built in speaker is finally right, its not stereo like the Bold but its also not tinny sounding like the 8900.  It sounds great.  The speaker for your ears sounds, to me, equally balanced for once...so it does'nt seem like someone is shouting in your ears..its a well balanced mid range sound.<br />Overall Feel: This Blackberry is HEAVY, and I mean heavy.

Enough said!<br /><br />Final Thoughts: The Tour comes with a newer version of the Blackberry operating system, v4.7.1.40, which is coincidentally used on the Storm.  The OS seems to be well suited for the Tour and is very responsive.  I did notice it stick here or there, but that has only happened 2-3 times and I am certain it was because I was taxing the device.  I am, thus far, quite happy with this new iteration of the Blackberry and hope that I will have many days ahead with it.<br /><br />Box Includes: Blackberry, Battery, AC Adapter w Word Adapter, Micro-USB Cable, Blackberry Ear Buds, Plastic/Pleather Holster, Documentation, Blackberry Desktop Manager SW CD, and a BONUS: 2GB Micro SD CARD.<br /><br />I could go on into much more detail, but it would be redundant as there are thousands of review"

The trick seems to be the intense high heat that you can only get from the 240 current that you don't usually have at home.  Anyway, this is a very good waffle mix (yeah, I know you can make pretty good pancakes with it too); the directions are simple; you just add some milk, egg, and butter in the quantities it directs you to use.  One trick I learned a while back (in my sourdough recipe) is to separate the eggs and put the yolks in; then take the whites and whip them up to like a meringue (lots of air in it--I put in a bit of cream of tartar), then mix that into the batter.  It makes the batter much lighter, and the waffles then are lighter and more airy.  Another trick is to use buttermilk; I think that makes them a little better too.  There's another good mix on the market called Garvey's authentic organic pancake & waffle mix, but it is quite expensive compared to Carbon's (see my review"

The power button is located right above where the hose connects at the bottom of the unit, along with a ‘ready’ indicator light. There is also a button on the steamer head to turn the steam flow on/off, which is handy when switching items or if you need a quick pause. The nozzle sits easily in the holder. The hose is sturdy, but flexible. The temperature setting is fixed (no controls/adjustments).  As a matter of preference, I attached the bristle brush attachment to help stay at the recommend 1/2” distance from the fabric.<br /><br />Water tank: Adequate. It holds a good quantity of water and the lines that mark the time/usage on the tank were accurate for my use. To add water, you flip up a hinged latch. I was initially a bit skeptical of how it would go to fill the unit since it seems like part of the opening is blocked with the lid. I was pleasantly surprised that the design actually helps keep splashes directed into the tank and was not an obstacle when I overfilled and had to empty out some of the water. As my tap water is really hard, I prefer to use distilled water and am leaving the water in the tank as I plan to use the steamer frequently. For roughly 25 clothing items, I used about 2/3 a gallon of water.<br /><br />Height: Worked for me. With the telescoping pool extended, I found that shirts and pants were at a very comfortable height to work with and that the hose length easily reached the front and back.

The continuous steam action made quick work of any wrinkles and easily penetrated my heavy cotton polo shirts (long and short-sleeved). Conversely, no matter how high I adjusted my iron (also with a steam feature), the polo shirts never looked smooth. I was also pleased at how soft the cotton felt after being steamed. Cotton and cotton/poly dress shirts steamed great, dress pants too. I plan to try the unit out on drapes and mattresses as well.<br /><br />Unlike with ironing, where I want shirts unbuttoned, I found that having things buttoned up made for easier steaming. Bonus: you can just slide the finished button shirt off the steamer hanger onto the hanger for the closet – no unbuttoning and re-buttoning required.<br /><br />Results: Excellent.

The November update makes all the difference in the world with the Titanium player!<br /><br />Now the picture quality is quite good, where it was simply adequate before. There is a noticeable quality improvement and smoothness to the image. I have a Slingbox Pro (the red one) also. I ran each of their current versions of their player and played the same channel side by side on my monitor. I sized them to be of similar size and left the settings at default. My Sling only takes S-Video as I don't have the $50 optional component cable dongle for it. It's attached to an H-21 DirecTV tuner. It was an interesting experiment. What I noticed was the image on the Sling was a little brighter and sharper but blocky and grainy. The image on the Hava was softer and more color accurate. Now again, this is at default, both can be adjusted, that said the Hava produced a more pleasant image. I was very impressed. I switched the Hava back and forth from S-Video to component. Honestly, they both looked very good. I'd be happy with the image from either. Technically the component might be a little better but both were more than watchable. I was on an HD football game for this test. I also put on CNN HD for scrolling text/ticker and it was quite impressive, very little if any ghosting. Quite good.<br />Now for the new added bonus with the November update. DVR capability is here. The old software would let you press record and it could record what was currently playing to your PC. OK, but not really a great feature. But, Sling doesn't do this at all so, 1 up. NOW if you add an external drive [...] to the USB port on the back of the device. You can schedule a recording by time date and channel. It's not as fancy as a grid driven DVR but it works. I stuck a 6GB WD portable mini drive in (which I'm not sure if it's on the list) and it saw the drive and recorded to it just fine. There are three quality settings. If you want to use the highest quality setting the drive needs to be formatted in FAT32. I tried the highest one and a one hour show (SportsCenter) filled more than half of my six gigs. It uses MPEG2 as its compression method, not the most efficient but it works. You'll need a big drive if you want to use this feature but again, no such option on Sling. Another thing it can do is pause and rewind what you are watching much like a DVR, it did that with the older software too, and Sling does do this also.<br /><br />If you have a mobile phone that's Windows Mobile, Nokia Tablet or Symbian you can get a free"

Assembly:  It took about 1.5 hours to assemble, but I'll admit I was watching TV and talking on the phone.  I am not at all mechanically inclined but it wasn't difficult at all.  Just two tools are needed, a Phillips screwdriver and a wrench.   However when I was finished it seemed like the lid hinges would not allow for complete closure of the lid and when I tried the latch on the front, the little wire that latches the top to the bottom snapped off; I thought it was broken.  I just stuck the wire back into the holes but I can see where this is going to be a persistent problem.    Portability: This thing is really heavy and not all that portable.  Yes, the two sides don't fold down but big deal, just pull them out.  But the grill itself is so big and clumsy that I would need someone to help me maneuver it down the stairs of my apartment.   In any event it wouldn't fit in my car, I have a two-door and I would have to remove a front seat to fit it into the back seat.  It won't fit in the trunk either, but I have a compact and I imagine it would fit in a bigger car.  But that's okay, because I can use it on my porch.

Once I found out about them, i was not sure they would be practical.<br /><br />The bottle does stand up by itself, and you can use it like a regular water bottle.  The real advantage is that it folds up and can be secured with an included band that is attached to the bottle.  This is so great for traveling.<br /><br />I really hate drinking out of public water fountains, but with this bottle, I can just put the empty, rolled bottle in my bag, and fill it when it is convenient for me.  It's great to keep in my purse or in my car.  At most public places, you can find a source of clean water but not a way to take any with you.  It has a carabiner-style thingy that allows you to attach it to the outside of your backpack.<br /><br />The narrow neck makes it harder to clean efficiently.  As long as you don't let it get too grody, this is probably not a big issue.  The big problem for me is that, even after multiple uses and multiple washings, water stored in the bottle for even a couple of hours has a rather funky taste to it.  I initially thought that taste would go away, but it has lingered.<br /><br />I got the pink color, which is listed as red, but looks pink on the product page.  Believe me, it is definitely pink, and I love the color.

However, going by the picture, there is an elegant touch that could potentially give you the impression that it could be in a normal watch rotation...should it work like a watch. Unfortunately, it cannot be taken seriously for keeping time although a few points of it are aesthetically pleasing enough to wear for looks only.<br /><br />Why this cannot be taken seriously for a normal everyday time-keeping watch is the following:<br /><br />1. Regular movement does not keep the spring wound enough to prevent stopping completely during a few hours of non-movement. Using this during a normal office day, it was behind 3 hours at the end of the day through intermittent stopping.<br />2. When the watch is fully wound, there was a 3 second delay every minute. This is extremely inaccurate for even the cheapest of automatic watches. This equates to be being behind 3 hours every day.

266718,1945164,"supplied items are all indicative of the price point, so the buyer gets a nice first impression.   While somewhat \\""plasticy\\"" with the glossy black exterior and white interior, these headphones are light enough to wear without feeling fatigued. I don't think I would wear them running, as I can't imagine them staying on well enough, and their size and appearance would be out of place in such use. That, and you want to hear the dump truck barreling down on you and not have these noise-cancelling cans mask that noise...  The headphones fold up and can be stored in the supplied hard-sided carrier, which is approximately 8\\"" x 6.5\\"". This carrier presumably makes it easy to take with you and it should provide adequate protection even when jostling in a crowd. (If you sit on it, the case isn't going to keep you from crushing its contents.) The inside of the carrier has a netted pocket for the two cords, one of which has controls for iPods/iPhones. The headphones have a socket for the cord, so you can interchange them at will, and is a necessity for the portability factor and replacing a damaged cord.  The AAA batteries (supplied) are inserted behind a rotating panel on the right ear, and while there are nubs to help you rotate the panel, it's a bit tricky to do. This becomes a concern especially when reattaching that panel, because if you don't get it secured, it's going to fall off and you'll look pretty funny walking around with exposed batteries while you try to find a replacement panel.  That battery compartment also contains a very important switch for the gain applied when noise cancellation is used. The default position is \\""Hi\\"" which is much too high, to the point of being dangerous to your hearing if you turn on the noise cancellation while listening. Changing the switch to \\""Lo\\"" is much better, and also changes the audio quality, which I'll touch on shortly.  Noise cancellation is enabled by sliding a switch on the left ear. The glossy nature of the plastic makes this switch surprisingly difficult to move, requiring a fingernail to apply the necessary leverage. Not a huge deal, but it's more difficult than it needs to be. On the plus side, you shouldn't have to worry about accidentally activating it.  One final note about the construction and packaging is that there is a button for lighting the white Soul logos on each ear when you have noise cancellation active. I'm not sure why anyone would want to do this, as these headphones already make a statement (\\""Hey, look at me, wearing Soul headphones\\""), but to each his own. At least they don't come on by default, and they aren't always on, which would have been over the top.  Now, on to the audio performance...  I enjoy music. My taste ranges from 80's pop music to country (both old school and contemporary), with jazz, blues, classical, movie scores, and others thrown in, depending on my mood.   I believe that my listening preferences are not low-end, but also not \\""audiofile\\"" and out of reach of the average person. I prefer the sound of Boston Acoustics speakers over most other brands of speakers I've auditioned. My computer speakers are Energy Take 5 satellite speakers connected to a Yamaha receiver, backed by an 8\\"" subwoofer. My car system is the best that was available from the factory.  I'm not a habitual headphone or earbud user. I don't DJ in my spare time. I don't fly on planes on a regular basis.   I have wanted to pick up a pair of over-the-ear headphones for occasional use. The best headphones I've ever heard were [[ASIN:B00001WRSJ Sony MDR-V6 Monitor Series Headphones with CCAW Voice Coil]], which made an incredible impression on me many years ago, and their reputation is easy to determine when reading just a few review"

I haven't been able to link my mobile app to my bank account in over a week.  I proceeded to contact Quicken for assistance.  The web site said that they had a large call volume and recommended I use the chat.

At this point, I was informed that since there was a new version of the software(Quicken 2014), I would have to pay for service assistance or buy the new software.  It was at this point, I was disconnected and discovered that my mobile app was no longer connected to my computer.  When I attempted to reconnect it, it would have wiped the mobile app in favor of the wrong computer data.<br /><br />  So at this point, I can not connect to my bank and I refuse to spend another dime on a program that doesn't work properly.

For my needs it is the right sort of size - not too big and not too small - for everyday or general use allowing me to carry a camera, lenses, batteries, and quite a few other bits and pieces that I may need when out and about taking pictures. The zips and tags all seem fine and the velcro &#34;spacers&#34; I have moved around to my hearts content to get them into the positions I want them in without problem and they seem firmly stuck in place. The shoulder straps are padded and adjustable and the carry handle on the top of the bag seems secure enough - as somebody else mentioned I think any wear on any of these items (as well as the bag itself or any other of its parts) would become apparent in good time unless you are particularly unlucky in this respect. The zips work and the zipper tags are still intact and seem secure enough. The bag I feel provides adequate protection for the equipment I carry in it and I wouldn't place my trust in just anything for the sake of it when it comes to camera equipment. There are two straps on the side of the bag for carrying a monopod - I think these will do the job provided you don't attach anything that's too heavy as I think doing so would potentially place too much of a strain on the straps over time as well as upset the balance of the bag from a practical &#34;carrying it&#34; point of view - a small lightweight monopod or small lightweight traveller tripod or similar would probably be okay - I don't carry my monopod attached to the bag for these reasons but I don't consider that to be an inconvenience.<br /><br />All things considered, I think it's a good bag for what it offers in terms of size and portability and it would probably afford a bit of protection from a light shower to the equipment it contains because of the type of material it's made from though common sense dictates that I wouldn't leave anything out in the rain that I didnt want to risk getting soaked. The bag I have received seems nicely finished without any obvious flaws though long term use will eventually determine how well its been made. My own feeling is that it's like anything - if looked after and not mistreated I am sure it will provide good service and do what I want it todo for some time to come with any potential failure becoming apparent in good time.<br /><br />So to conclude (unless I need to suddenly amend this review"

The directions refer to pressing the \\""Set/Scan\\"" button but no such button exists. I quickly figured out they meant the \\""Down/Pair\\"" button and indeed that works and causes the display to flash. Then you simply line up the IR communication ports on the transmitter and receiver and they are linked. The positioning of the IR sensor on the transmitter under the battery door makes sense to avoid interference once it is set up but if you don't know it is there you could easily search for it as no where in the manual does it really tell you where it is. There is a sentence which says \\""While the receiver display is flashing hold the transmitter IR node in alignment with the receiver IR node within a distance of approximately 12 inches. The receiver will automatically set the transmitter channel. When the display stops flashing the system is \\""Scan-Link'd'\\"" - although at least it does not appear to be a google translation it might as well be.<br /><br />The microphones themselves are actually both quite good and should work well for public speaking as we will use them.

The TV option is a non-starter in the states, as over-the-air signals are now digital, and this only accepts analog.

The phone was a little loose and I was able to get the speakers to sound fine when I leaned it forward. This is when I realized I needed to use the back support with the rubber pad. I tried the smaller rubber pad first and it sounded the same(crappy), then tried the thicker pad and it sounded great. I find it somewhat difficult to change between these two pads. This is somewhat annoying because I need the thin pad for my iPhone 3Gs and my wife uses the thicker pad for her iPhone 4. I may see if I can't get a second plastic support and put the other rubber pad on that. The plastic support easily pops in and out (but not too easy, it will stay in place when moving the dock). Note: I have to remove cases off the phones to make them fit properly. My wife has a really thin case on her iPhone4 but it still needs to be removed to sit properly.

However, that said, in metal the focus is the guitars, and using a mic placement that makes the guitars sound like they were recorded by a bootstrap sony micro tape player MISSES THE POINT.  Turns them into little tin-canny things, when they're supposed to be BIG.  If these bands went to play live with their guitars sounding like they do on their albums, they'd be laughed off the stage.  I have no idea why so many of the early bands in sweden had this lo-fi sound.  I know that in black metal it was largely deliberate.  Personally I think its because these bands recorded themselves, and instead of finding a friend who was an engineer, they got their other guitar buddy to be an engineer.  Guitarists and engineers are natural enemies.  Getting a good and big guitar tone isn't hard and can be done with crappy radio shack mics.<br /><br />That said the only other real beef I have with pre-slaughter At the Gates is the vocals.  Dry bed of nails down the ears.  Raw, and not elegant.

365509,671261,"obtained items will net a new ability in the grid.  <br /> <br />However, there is much bad about this game. First, the characters move much too slowly while walking. Many of the rooms/streets/towns are very large, and it is annoying to move like a tortoise through the streets. It isn't as much of a problem in combat (since so much of combat is up-close and personal), but it is a pain otherwise. Thankfully, the developers have instituted a GREAT teleport system. Cross a save point on a world, and you can teleport from there to any other save point on that world, and back. The save points are generously distributed, so travel isn't TOO much of a chore, but it is still slow. <br /> <br />Another annoyance is the high encounter rate. In some areas (the lower levels of the mines of Vesan, anyone?), one fights enemies every couple of steps. Battles are often grueling, and party members are inept at guarding, resulting in many items used per battle. The developers definitely erred on the difficult side for these battles, and the results are less than stellar. Thankfully, the system is somewhat broken - the main character has some incredible attacking spells, which can destroy groups in a single blow, as well as allow him to snipe mimics (the worst enemies in the game) from afar. The spells are expensive, but thanks to the friendly teleport system, one can simply return to an item shop, stock up on AP-restoring items, and return to the heat of battle. The amount of money made is absurd, and the levels go up quickly. Is it cheating? Possibly, but otherwise, the game slows to a crawl. Utilize it to the fullest. <br /> <br />When characters are walking, they will sometime make an exclamation (in the form of a voiceover, usually describing the characters thoughts on the situation at hand). Without a doubt, this is one of the biggest misfires in the game. Each character has about 4 thoughts on each situation, and the length of some quests assure that you'll hear these same thoughts, OVER AND OVER. To add insult to injury, if you decide to explore your surroundings, often you will hear another character say, \\""Are we going the right way?!?\\"" I don't know about you, but an RPG that PUNISHES me for exploration  is one of the dumber ideas in existence. I don't know what the developers were thinking - the most annoying aspect of \\""DC2\\"" was adding the voice module to the robot helper. However, you could always REMOVE the module. This is 10x worse. <br /> <br />Another problem is the story. I love the idea of pirates searching the galaxy for treasure - why do I have to be bothered with the stale idea of \\""evil corporation bent on ruling the galaxy!\\""?

Moen's other slanted neck models that I've used sit lower in the sink, so the high neck models always won in my kitchen.  This model, though, has a lot of the advantages of a high neck model in a more compact form factor.  In short, there's a lot to like about this faucet.<br /><br />I had the privilege of auditioning this for Vine.  Out of the seven major models that I've tried from Moen since late 2012, this is now my third favorite (behind the Arbor and Brantford models)...and it's a close third...and one that I'm very happy to use.  However, the current price of $380 is pretty high, IMO.  The Arbor design that I like very much costs much less at (currently) $240 in chrome.  Definitely look for sales and price changes, though!  I've noticed the price for the Arbor design fluctuate a lot over the past two years.<br /><br />In October 2012, I bought a [[ASIN:B0087AQ0MC Moen Arbor in Spot Resist Stainless]] (5 stars), and I have to say it was the best faucet that I'd ever owned.  Two months later, I was able to try the very similar [[ASIN:B007Y6LL1K Moen Arbor With Motionsense]] (also 5 stars), which is of equally high quality but with motion sensors.  Since then, I've tried six other Moen faucets, including this one (4.5 stars rounded up to 5), the [[ASIN:B00CIXF25K Brantford with Motion Sense in Chrome]] (5 stars), [[ASIN:B00GG16WDQ Brookshire in Spot Resist Stainless]] (4 stars), [[ASIN:B000F66YVS Extensa in Chrome]] (3 stars), [[ASIN:B00BSXOEKA Align in Chrome]] (3 stars), and [[ASIN:B002IP4PA6 Integra in Classic Stainless]] (3 stars).<br /><br />I've liked some more than others, and up until this past weekend when I tried the Brantford and this Tilt, none of them had given me the same feeling of value as the Arbor.  The Brantford is essentially the Arbor with different aesthetics.  This Tilt is the best non-high-neck model that I've tried from Moen.  It if cost the same as the Arbor, I would struggle in my recommendation.  However, with the Tilt being currently over $140 more, I whole heartily recommend giving the Arbor a look.  If you prefer the lower profile and looks of this design, however, I do not think that you'll be disappointed.  I still like the Arbor a little better because (1) the Arbor pullout spout lets you stop the flow of water on the spout itself where this one doesn't, and (2) I just think the Arbor is a better overall value right now.

384647,203516,"receiver unit, sub, remote, speaker wires, AM and FM antennas, a wall mount for the sound bar itself, and instructions. The remote takes a couple of AAA batteries that Sharp neglects to give you. If the remote took AA batteries maybe I could have forgave their exclusion in the package but AAA batteries are a little less common to have laying around.  The amp for the sub is in the receiver unit so you only need a single wire going to the sub. However the sound bar has three separate speakers in it, one for the L/C/R channels each, and each speaker has its own wire that needs to be run to the receiver unit. That makes sense but it isn't the cleanest setup that they could have chosen. I like the fact that it is normal wires and connectors but dislike the messy look it creates. They could have rectified this by supplying a cheap black plastic flexible tube to run all the wires through between the sound bar and receiver unit.  There is no onscreen overlay put up onto the display to see what you are doing. I don't so much have a problem with that, in my mind the less they are messing with the signal going through the better as I am sure some people that own full blown home theater receivers will attest to, but what they give you is a little LCD screen. If you are a distance from the receiver unit this could be a issue for some people, it gets difficult to read at a distance with its blue on blue appearance.  The fan that everyone talks about is for sure there and you will notice it when using the unit at lower volumes.  I use a Roku 2 XS connected to this and have noticed that the receiver unit won't process the DD+ (Dolby Digital Plus) audio track that is present on some Netflix titles, the stereo track on those titles works fine still though. I checked the specs and see that the receiver unit does DTS, Dolby Digital and Dolby Pro Logic. Just something to keep in mind if that matters to you.  I'm having a difficult time review"

The verb tenses are not explained which is of course very important in Spanish.  Yes, it's supposed to mimic how we all learned our first language, but the problem is, I'm obviously not 18 months old and really can't learn like that.  Another problem is that within the lessons, there are no distracters.  For instance:  The user is presented with three phrases and three pictures and is required to match them up.  One picture of a man, one of a woman and one of a boy all engaged in some kind of activity.  The problem is that I can easily recognize the word 'hombre' for 'man,' so that's the obvious choice.  Therefore I can choose the right answer without understanding anything about the phrase itself.  There needs to be other similar phrases as a distraction so the user is forced to decipher the meaning without just picking the obvious choice.       WARNING:  The \\""Audio Companion\\"" is completely useless!  It's just the soundtrack to the lessons (no translation).  How am I to know what the speaker is saying without any point of reference!?      WARNING:  DO NOT rely on this product exclusively to learn a language.  You'll need to constantly refer to a translation website and (even better) a friend who's fluent in the language you're learning.  Example:  A picture of a child at the piano and the parents behind him.  The phrase associated with it is, \\""Los padres están escuchando.\\""  \\""The parents are listening.\\""  But I had to get it translated because I didn't know if the verb meant watching, listening, teaching, etc.  There has to be a way to reveal the translation within the program.      OK...  I am learning, but that's because I'm using Rosetta Stone only as a baseline.  I am also using homemade flashcards, books and dictionaries, translation websites, patient friends who are nativeSpanish speakers and other free"
396448,1791059,"got this item because I misread the product info and thought it was cast iron. It's not; it's cast aluminum. I did some searching and it seems Cast Aluminum is a new trend competing with more traditional cast iron. Proponents of this new cookware say it is superior. I'm not convinced.<br /><br />If you are looking for an enameled cast iron braiser or dutch oven, I suggest looking at those made by Lodge Logic or Le Creuset.<br /><br />I'm only deducting a single star because I don't care for the material the pan is made of. You might not have my biases. If you want a cast aluminum pan, this seems like a great choice. First let me explain and disclose my biases.<br /><br />I don't really like aluminum for my cookware. It is an efficient thermal conductor, but lacks the density and mass to really hold onto that heat and distribute it evenly and slowly to the food, which is what you want when looking for a braiser like this one. Aluminum is also very thermally responsive, meaning it reacts quickly to changes in heat input. This can be good in a pan where you want fine control for quick-cooking items; not so much when you are leaving something to simmer or braise all day on the stove top and you want a thermal buffer between that flame (which never seems to get quite low enough) and your stew, for example. The enamel coating, which I thought was ceramic, is not ceramic and so it won't help with this. I don't know what the coating is as the manufacturer doesn't say. They do say it doesn't chip the way that ceramics do, which would be nice, but I haven't used it enough or tried to test that claim. It \\""feels\\"" durable.<br /><br />Aluminum is also chemically reactive, meaning you shouldn't cook acidic foods in aluminum unless it has been treated (anodized), sandwiched between other metals (clad), or coated with some intermediary material (non-stick) lest it leach into your food causing foul flavors and potentially impacting your health (the evidence there is inconclusive atthe moment, but I tend to adhere to the Precautionary Principle: if it's unnatural, you have to prove it *won't* harm me before I will expose myself to it regularly and willingly, not the other way around).<br /><br />This pan has a nonstick coating of some type, though I can't figure out what. It doesn't say on the box, in the product info, or in the instructions. Is it PTFE (generic term for \\""Teflon\\"")? Who knows. But I avoid PTFE due to health concerns (see note in last paragraph for my policy on \\""unproven\\"" health concerns) and because it scratches and flakes off, even when the manufacturer says it won't, as the manufacturer says here. You won't be cooking over high heat usually with a braiser, so there is less concern that you will create the fumes that people worry about with PTFE, but that's only if you don't brown your food in this pan. But, then again, browning food in nonstick is silly anyway as you get no fond on the bottom of the pan. It's also still a mystery as to whether the coating here is PTFE, or something else (therefore we can't even hypothesize about whether or not this pan is PFOA free"

397147,892173,"got this product because I have a bad habit of slouching, and because of that my posture isn't good.  By having to look up at my computer monitor, my posture improves, which is amazing for me.  The monitor riser comes in the the box pretty much fully put together, and it is basically a plastic stand with a clear piece of plastic in the middle for you to put your monitor on.  It is almost futuristic looking, and I think that it seems very durable.  The box has a little bit of information on it, but the information is in ten different languages, which I thought was cool.  The riser by itself is about 4 inches tall, but there are 2 little height adjustment tabs that you can stick into the legs to bump the riser up about a half inch each.  The full height you can have is about 5 inches.  The tabs a little bit wobbly to stick in, but once you actually have the riser turned right-side-up with the monitor on it, they seem perfectly stable.<br /><br />I only have two small complaints about this product.

So let me first get the scolding out of the way.<br /><br />I installed from the Mac mini via the USB and CD, both of which were provided. It is via the software, through the USB cable that you can set the printer for wireless operation. After that, it should be all wireless. I chose to set a static IP address instead of allowing it to pull one from DHCP. If there are connectivity problems with any of my devices, I want to be able to ping the printer without having to look up its IP address. Everything appeared to go well, right up until the installation software instructed me to remove the USB cable and fly on my own.<br /><br />I tried to print from the Mac but it didn't work. According to the software, the printer was offline. I tried restarting the printer, restarting the Mac, re-installing the driver, and cursing at the printer. I knew the cursing wouldn't work, but it made me feel better.<br /><br />Now then, if I were a Mac guy, you can bet I'd be much more upset and I would have given this product 2 or 3 stars. But I don't use my Mac for printing, so it didn't bother me much. That's why I say Mac users beware. If you want to print from a Mac, prepare yourself for some frustration. I will eventually get it printing from the Mac, but the fact that it will take a little more than casual tinkering caused me to knock off a star.<br /><br />The printer was properly set up from the Mac despite not being able to print from the Mac. I know this because when setting up the PC, the software detected that the printer had already been configured. Setting up the PC (Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit) was a breeze.

While each manufacturer has had their quirks, I have received the best value from Linksys/Cisco.<br /><br />I usually upgrade the router in my home every 12-16 months .  I didn't upgrade earlier  this year because of the cisco connect fiasco.  Don't worry if you don't know what this is.  It was basically a marketing blunder that Linksys pushed out onto its customers that changed the way that users were allowed to configure their routers.  This upgrade also ocurred without a users consent, and this gave me pause. Linksys later retracted this update and allowed users to return to an earlier firmware, but I'm sure this cost them several customers in the process.<br /><br />Enter the 4500.  I had done quite a bit of research.  The 3700 N600 was the main competitor to the Linksys product I currently own.  While it was certainly next generation from a chipset and memory standpoint, it's performance wasn't so remarkable that I felt like upgrading was warranted.  A 4000 N750 series was introduced shortly thereafter, but only offered a slight performance increase on the 5.0Ghz radio (300 > 450) making it's cost to value ratio low and once again not making an upgrade a worthwhile investment.<br /><br />The 4500 changed this.  It utilizes the fastest Broadcom chipset currently available in its class and is equipped with more/faster memory than its competitors.  In addition, it increases the bandwidth performance on the 2.4 radio dramatically for those using wireless adapters capable of enhanced performance.<br /><br />The biggest selling point for me however was the enhanced features and user configuration available in its firmware.  It's light years ahead of any Linksys product currently. My review"

I'm not sure if this is just a matter of getting used to the product but basically that's my issue. Also, my unit's container for the dirty water (bottom) when taken out comes out with the cover (which has the filter in it) quite easily. Good thing I went through the unit first before I actually used it. Otherwise, I could've easily dropped the bottom water container for dirty water and spilled all the dirty water on the floor because there's nothing securing or locking the top part cover (the one that has the filter in it) to the bottom container (for dirty water) - it just comes out as 2 separate units when taken out so I've to hold on to both.<br /><br />Other than all of the above, THIS UNIT SHOCKED ME!

Then the site automatically downloads a setup.zip file which you naturally open and extract the setup program from.  Launch the installer and you are asked to Agree & Install - there is also a little checkbox (checked off by default) to have you enroll in the 'Norton Community Watch' program which is to help in the fight against digital cybercrime....this basically automatically forwards any threats found on your computer to Symantec....highly recommended.  Click on Agree & Install and the application begins to actually download the program which has to be installed...the time required here depends on your bandwidth at home....  The application now installs.  Once completed, Safari is launched and you are prompted to install a Norton security extension.  Restart when done....<br /><br />PC – 2 – Running Windows 7 Ultimate x64 and Windows 8.1 x64.  Pretty much the same exact steps as above.....<br /><br />Flaw (for me): I do not use Internet Explorer on PC and or Safari on the MAC as my default browser.  The Norton product installs extensions for both of those browsers and not for Chrome (my default on both computers).<br /><br />Flaw 2 for me: I am not yet convinced that mac’s need antivirus protection….for web and internet security, sure…but if you use some general common sense and the free"
456326,806982,"got this unit for geocaching in urban and near urban areas. Garmin has some cheaper units, but they're either in B&W (not a big deal) or has a serial interface. I highly recommend getting a unit with USB interface unless you're running Windows 95 on a really old machine. Not only is the transfer speed much faster, some new machines (and many laptops) no longer has a serial port.    Performance of the unit is very good. It even managed to get a lock in my house, something my Nuvi could not do. Do bear in mind that the position is updated once every second, and the \\""compass\\"" is only accurate if you're moving for a few seconds in a straight line. This is true for all GPSr that does not have an electronic compass.    The unit is small and fits very well in my hands - much easier than holding a Nuvi which I was using before this arrived. With the black case, it looks vaguely enough like a cell phone that people will not give you a second look when you're out hunting for a cache.    Waypoint names are 14 characters long, and it only holds 500 waypoints. Geocaching feature in this unit mainly consists of the ability to mark a waypoint as \\""found\\"", after which you're asked if you want to go to the next closest waypoint. Searching for a cache would, by default, filter out found caches. And you can view the calendar to see when you found which cache - useful if you are logging your finds after a few days out hunting without Internet access.    The main limitations of this unit is : very limited basemap, no sensor, no memory expansion capability. There are units that has those features, but none come close to the price of the Venture HC. If you want those features, go for a GPSMap 60CSx - at almost 3 times the price. Or spend even more and get a Colorado or Oregon for paperless caching.    If you want some free"

I've been using this for about 2 years now so have a pretty good idea on the pros and cons.<br /><br />I agree that setup can be a pain, though it seems to mostly be a driver issue and poor ability to control the mixers and mute what you need to through logical software menus.  Ironically I have more trouble with Win 7 than I did on XP.  A few things to note:  The phono-in and the line-in is a shared connection, though it's very difficult to tell through the software which was it's configured.  I wish instead of controlling this through software there was a physical toggle switch on the rear of the unit to select.  If you plug something in through the line-in and it sounds awfully distorted, it's running through the phono preamp and you need to mute this input (good luck finding it in the windows mixer and the creative version, it's terrible to hunt for and not obvious at all).  Once you get that sorted out, you'll be able to enjoy HD AM/FM radio from your Sony XDR-F1, at least until you undock your Win7 computer and then redock.  At this point, everything will look like it's configured fine but you just won't hear anything.  The solution is to go into the windows mixer and disable the line input and then re-enable, and you're back in business.  I did not have this issue in WinXP.<br /><br />So how about quality?  Well it's really quite incredible, and the dedicated headphone amp is all the more impressive considering it gets its power from the USB 500mA connection rather than an external power source (like the NX did).

464001,2994604,"given this unit relatively low scores, but very willing to change them up as I can get the performance up to what's expected. If not, then I will return them and that's that.  2-26-2011: The units arrived in perfect shape, promptly, in good condition, as it is the norm with Amazon's service: simply great.  I was able to connect my unit and see it on my wireless laptops immediately (my friend though, has not been able to see the drive yet on his PC, we'll have to check further)  PROS: The units is nice, much smaller than I thought and don't take too much space, quiet, nice  CONS: Many unfortunately. Even though I have been dealing with computers for a long time although not professionally (I have build 3 PCs of my own, installed and re-installed many OSs... many... many times, etc). I have not been able to figure out this unit yet.   Western Digital, again, demonstrates the same problem I have had with the many computer (and related products) manufactures: mainly their INABILITY to explain thins in a SIMPLE MANNER for regular users like me who are not professionals or \\""gurus.\\"" Technical people are so FULL OF IT (technical jargon), they simply CAN NOT bring themselves down to the level of most people, like myself, even though as I said I have vast experience with computers.   Now, one area I don't know is simply NETWORKS AND PERMISSIONS etc... I always thought this subject to be difficult (abstract enough) and sure enough I get lost with all the myriad of password and permissions and what not... very confusing. SO FAR the only area I can access in the drive is the \\""public share /pictures/videos.\\"" I was able to put many pictures in that partition/directory. Also I moved many of my \\""videos/movies\\"" to the \\""videos\\"" directory (in the Drive) which opened up a lot of space on mylocal laptops, which is good. Now the BAD thing - and I hope I just don't know how to do it correctly - is to watch my movies/videos CONTINUOUSLY rather than at little jerky sections (a bit of the movie and stops... then more movie and stops...) as it did when I tried. Obviously the Drive and wireless transmission (My wireless router uses \\""g\\"" or \\""n\\"" I believe the fastest available) is not fast enough to move the data so it will show the movie \\""normally.\\"" DEFINITELY NOT \\""STREAMING VIDEO\\"" in this instance, but I am hoping I just don't know how to set it up yet, since this is so heavily advertised on these drives.  The other thing I have not figured it out is all that business of being able to access your Drive via that website (forgot the name now) remotely from the Internet, etc.  Even the very CD that comes with the unit is not CLEAR enough. The first time I ended up \\""Installing\\"" the drive like 3 times!... I don't even know if I suppose to install some application from the CD rom in each of the computers connected to the Network Drive... Logic would make me think I would need to do that from each computer with access to the NAS drive, but I have not found anything on that subject yet.  Ok, enough for now, I will update this review"

Within about 2 minutes, the water is hot and it's ready to go - drop in a K-Cup and press Brew! You can select from 4 different sizes (8oz, 10oz, 12oz, or iced coffee), and you can also program in a default size so that you don't have to select the size every time you brew. Programming the auto power on and off is also a breeze.  I also enjoy the ability to dispense hot water so that you can make tea or other hot beverages.<br />My only complain has to do with water capacity. It has an 80oz reservoir, but the maximum fill line is an inch from the top, and the brewer is not capable of pulling water from the tank once the water line falls to about 3\\"" from the bottom, which makes the effective capacity only about 2/3 of what it claims. This means you will need to refill it after every 4 or 5 cups of 12oz coffee.

It is not as easy-to-use as the Voyager Pro.  When using the earbud alone (without the earloop), it does not stay on and sometimes falls out.  Because of this, I use it only when I am in my office, in the car, or at home and need to talk on the phone and do other things.  I don't wear it when I am walking or moving too much.  If I need to use it while I am walking the dog, I use the earloop.  Not a big deal, but it is an extra step to take.<br />- When it is very windy, the noise cancellation works too efficiently and the person on the other end cannot hear me.  Also, I tried using it while driving a convertible, and the person on the other end cannot hear me at all.<br /><br />- Finally, after three weeks of use, the power \\""button\\"" gave out.

I tried it in my office (a typical phone/computer environment), and near a loud room fan (trying to simulate a jet).<br /><br />* The biggest problem- they just didn't seem to reduce any noise, and did seem to induce a hiss. My first experiment was to put the phones in my ears, and not connect any input to them. Turning them on gives a slight, but clearly audible hiss. Over the hiss I could still hear all the normal office noises, a TV played on low volume, and the \\""whoosh\\"" of a cheap window fan. The sound was maybe attenuated a couple dB, but not enough to matter. As a rough estimate, I'd say they had maybe 25% of the noise reduction capability of my Bose headphones.<br /><br /> Turning up the volume didn't really eliminate the hiss,it just faded into the background. One of the true joys for me of the Bose headphones is listening to classical music-where an instrument bursts out from total silence. I never got that feeling from these.<br /><br />* The instructions seem overly complex...and I believe a technoprobe might find them slightly intimidating. They are also sometimes less than clear. For example, I pushed the power button numerous times waiting for it to flash out the status code for the noise reduction mode. Finally I noticed the little LED's on the actual ear pieces.<br /><br />* The power button seemed overly small and fussy, and was too close to my ear.<br /><br />* The unit seemed somewhat \\""flimsy\\"". Not that it was constructed poorly, just that I would be surprised if the relatively thin wires held up to the rough handling of travel. There are no signs of stress relief any any of the connections.<br /><br />---Overall<br /><br />* Compared to the Bose headphones, which are roughly $100 less, I just don't see the value of these. Yes, they are smaller and take up less space, but I just would not expect them to hold up to jostling around in a carry on. The noise reduction was very limited-bordering on non-existent, and the headphones just weren't comfortable for me to wear. There was a very annoying hiss present at all times.<br /><br />* If I had paid the retail price, I would have returned them ASAP. To be honest, I am not 100% sure that the pair I review"

I don’t know about that –but she loved all the toys (Wonder Wheel, Flutterby Teether, Froggy Rattle, Soft Hanging bugs, Ladybug Play Station, and the Sunshine Spinner).  It’s nice that the toys are removable, as my niece likes to crawl around with the froggy.<br /><br />The assembly of the product was quite easy.

535971,238019,"got this product so that I could use it when I moved from the US to Switzerland.  It worked flawlessly, FOR the First 3 months.  I was getting near HD quality from Michigan to Switzerland 2.5 to 2.8mbs signal.  It varied at times but for the most part that was acceptable.  Then they rolled out a firmware update, and I accepted it and it still worked for another month.  Then in December (just in time for the College Football Bowl Games) my player was receiving a steady signal at 120kbs.  This occured from France/Switzerland/friends who were in Michigan etc. all got the same signal.  It had nothing to do with the quality of the internet service.  Their Warranty and support is a sham.  I tried but got no help and told the same $30, $50 story.  The fact is it is clearly a problem with their equipment.  In fact I had my friend at home reset everything box, router, etc.  This fixed the problem and I thought it was a glitch and wondered why they didn't post this issue/fix on their website.  Well, that only worked for about three weeks and now it is streaming between 120kbs and 200kbs.  At least now I do get a picture, the first time it was sound only.    It is such a necessary product for me, but they have mismanaged the support so badly I am thinking of junking it and cancelling cable modem in US and cancelling direct TV.      Also of note, there is a part of their site that claims now that they know about this problem and requests all sorts of information and feedback"

536211,2262094,"got the unit installed.    The first few hours were pristine.  Perhaps I was just happy to have an AC after being without one for a week.  But here it is now, less than a week, and there DEFINITELY IS A CHIRPING SOUND whenever the compressor is running.  Think of it as a LOUD REFRIGERATOR compressor.  It might be tolerable, except that I have my AC in my office... just a few feet from my work area.    The AC cools fabulously.  The remote control is great.  There are a number of features I have yet to explore.  Just thought you should know to watch for the NOISE.  Sadly, I don't know that it can be avoided.  If not on this unitl.  It will be on whatever AC you do buy.  And even if the model is highly rated, you can never tell if you're going to get a dud.    Good luck!    ADDED October 3rd, 2014  At the time I purchased this Frigidaire AC I also purchased an EXTENDED WARRANTY from Frigidaire. I was enticed by their printed literature stating that I could have a factory technician do onsite repairs. This week I learned that Frigidaire will NEVER send a technician to your home. Not even for their BASIC ONE YEAR WARRANTY. The best you can hope for (if you kept your packaging) is to exchange it for a new unit from Amazon. And hoping you'll get a unit that doesn't make the same AWFUL NOISE is a crap shoot. FYI if you want Frigidaire onsite tech support you must buy a unit rated 10,000 BTUs or HIGHER.    Funny how nobody, Amazon or Frigidaire, states that before you put down your money.    ADDED September 5th, 2014  Seeing as AMAZON is using our uncompensated review"
536269,3321523,"got the unit home, set it up, and did a firmware update.  I was really impressed with the auto speaker calibration, thought it was very cool and the speakers seemed to be very well balanced. What I wasn't impressed with was how little control a person has over the EQ settings.  The only real adjustment for the EQ was for bass and treble. You are pretty much a slave to the preset sound modes.  Not much tweaking available...  NOW the big thing that went wrong... as I had said, I updated the firmware.  Within seconds of the firmware update finishing, I got the dreaded HDMI failure!  I had read about the HDMI issues, and FYI THEY ARE REAL!!!!! The tv screen went to a pink screen that was all lines... I was heartbroken over this, as I had VERY high hopes for a long future with this unit!  To my dismay I only had the chance to spend little more than ONE HOUR with this thing!!  Sadly my one experience with Onkyo will be my last.  So if you do buy this unit, I suggest you DO NOT do a firmware update, but if you don't do an update then you miss out on the biggest perk to buying this unit.  The biggest perk IMO, is that it is upgrade able to the new Atmos software coming out from Dolby. If you do update, you are doing it at your own risk!!!  Overall I was not impressed with this unit, or Onkyo.  I am not supper sour about the experience, I just know now that Onkyo is not the high quality brand that most people think it is.  My suggestion research, research, research before you buy this or any receiver....  Update: So I bit the bullet and bought another Onkyo as I don't dowell at holding grudges. This time I bought the NR656.  So far, 3 months in, the thing seems to work very well!  I am overall very happy with this unit, but honestly I don't expect it to last for years and years.  If it does by chance last for 8-10 years, I don't think I would have any desire to upgrade as this seems to fulfill all of the items on my checklist for a good Receiver.

537083,20502,"got the products, they worked marginally well. Despite extensive training, they never quite worked the way they should, and it never \\""learned\\"" as described. As OSX systems would update, their software would conveniently fail to be compatible with the updates, requiring a whole new purchase, at the low, low price of $200 a pop. Your license also expires after a few months, so if you computer crashes, and even if you boot from a backup, you'll need to renew your license, which costs an extra fee.<br /><br />I updated to 3.0, when I really should have stopped after 1.5. Guess what? Still doesn't work as described. The cursor would skip to a complete new page and start typing text into some random paragraph before jumping up another page and inserting mystery text into yet another paragraph.<br /><br />Today drew the line. I opened up Word to type a simple letter. Upon clicking the microphone button, an error message popped up on a loop, preventing me from closing either Word or Dragon. After Force Closing and repeating this process multiple times, the problem persisted.<br /><br />I go to the Dragon website to learn that because my product is more than a year old, they don't provide support for it anymore, and to get support would be $10. As their support had been pretty terrible before, I wasn't going to fork over another $10 to have them tell me that I needed to buy a new upgrade (which I'm sure is simply going to be an opportunity for them to pitch me some other product that won't work as described). I have downloaded all the current updates. I have the most recent version, but I am no longer covered, and they won't fix their mistake, so I'm done.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Dragon is a VERY expensive product. It does not work like you want it to. Nuance will not stand behind their product, and they will find ways to nickel and dime you until you finally quit them. You will need to upgrade when Apple pushes a new version of OSX out, and that upgrade is not free"

543755,1935507,"got the item (not a negative comment on the merchant as we had spent a few days looking around in the local stores first). I simply assembled the mower (if it can be called assembling, since only handle bars need be attached), took out the battery and plugged it to charge.<br /><br />Now weight wise, it is not overly heavy so not sure why some people complained about weight, I was alone and could easily enough unpack the lawnmower on my own, albeit depending on age I can see it getting harder in later years (I'm mid-aged average built guy). Having said that battery pack IS removable which is probably half the weight of the whole lawn mower, so taking battery pack out before trying to flip mower onto its side or carrying it would make things much easier.<br /><br />Anyhow, a few days later, after battery had charged for about 76 hours I was ready to test it out (see notes below). I really like the separate controls for the drive system and blade. This made moving lawn mower around as easy as inserting the safety key and squeezing the red bar. Start up took a bit of getting used to, I had by mistake held the blade bar &#34;primed&#34; while pushing the start button and obviously it did not want to start. Having said that after I employed correct procedure (insert the safety key, push the start button then squeeze the blade bar) the mower started quite nicely. I was pleasantly surprised at how much quieter it is than the old gas powered lawn mower. At times it made me feel silly since I felt that neighbors might look out and laugh at me trying to mow the grass with a &#34;toy&#34;. But after the first pass over the grass that was at least 12 inches long I stopped feeling silly or embarrassed.<br /><br />The mower did slow down in a couple of spots with an audible change to the sound of the motor, but that made no difference to how it was cutting. The 12 inch grass was down to about 4 inches. I had done the front part of the property and thought that after 15 minutes or so I better check battery level before moving on. Still had 3 lights light up upon pushing the info button on the battery pack. I decided to do the side yard too. That part of the yard is actually on some 30 degree incline in parts. It was a breeze and not any harder to do that the flat part of the property was. After doing both front and side some 25 minutes into the run I decided to check the battery level again. It still had 2 lights on. Damn, I guess I had better do the back as well. So I did, the back yard was not much worse than the front part I had already done so no surprise there, lawn mower performed flawlessly. After finishing the back yard some 35 minutes into the run with the lawn mower I thought (read hope) battery would HAVE to be on one light or nearly empty... Wrong!!! Still had 2 lights on.<br /><br />We have a property with attached lot where a long time ago another house used to be, before it burned down. That part of the property is also ours. We had not mowed that part for a long, LONG while. The grass there was probably up to my knees in some places (I'm some 6 feet tall). I set the height of the mower up to the max for this one. The terrain is also completely different from front or side yard. It's more or less flat with a few holes and mounds scattered throughout the lot (blame the dogs). The mower had a challenge set here. The motor whined and in quite a few places it sounded as if it might &#34;choke up&#34;. It was painful to listen. Having said that it did superbly. It never stopped completely and although I did have to go over a few places couple of times to get everything even, it did it all. and all that was done on 1 charge. I might have freak of the factory or something but I'm pretty sure that the battery pack lasted for around 1 hour. When I was done it still had 1 light on. I stopped when it reached one light of remaining charge after doing about half of the second lot. Great and easy to use mower here...<br /><br />Note: The lawn mower above was ordered as new from CPO Outlets (I believe) and the item itself was indeed new, blade showed signs of use however (numerous dents and chips on the leading edge of the blade were discovered while unpacking, this also led to the long wait period of about 3 days before using the mower), even with blade not as perfect as it could be the lawn mower performed better than I had hoped for. CPO were not able to exchange the blade for a new one so they suggested that I contact manufacturer, which was done some 7-ish days ago. B&D are yet to reply, in the meantime I had contacted Amazon directly and they had me order a new blade and have refunded the full cost of the new blade without the obligation to do so. That was REALLY appreciated and it allowed me to cut the overgrown jungle-lawn down to size using the beat up blade while waiting for the replacement. Amazon service is beyond anything I had expected, after years of using their service they still have ability to surprise me.<br /><br />Update (September 11th 2012): Edited a couple of spelling mistakes.<br /><br />Update (February 5th 2014): It's been a while since I re-review"

These also have no inline controls on the cord which when compared to the SkullCandy FIX has these coming up a bit short. I use the SkullCandy FIX for my workouts (which are awesome) and the Klipsch for my daughters soccer game (so not to hear all the screaming parents)  :)  If I could do it all over again I would have gone with the SkullCandy FIX as the sound easily rival the Klipsch and also include inline controls for sound hand free

Now this isn't a big problem so I'm not going to take a hole star off.<br /><br />The second problem is the mic can't be adjusted to a different position even though it says it can, no problem what so ever because the mic can hear me fine, its not quite or too loud. This was no problem to me but for others it might be, I am not going to take a star because of this, just to let others know.<br /><br />My third problem is when I go into the accessories settings where you can set the volume to 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, you can also hear your self as a tester, well as I could hear myself I could hear a lot of other noises, not background noises as it was silent in my house, it was like a mini fan was inside the earpeice, this affects my speech but not that much, just a bit annoying to my friends, so because of this I'm not going to take a whole star away.<br /><br />Now, the good thing was the speaker is incedivle for such a small thing, I could hear them like crystal!<br /><br />Also the mic can hear you from quite a distance which is great so you don't have to put it right by your mouth, in fact you could have it half way up your face and it could still hear you!<br /><br />OK, my review"

Not much damage to outside of box but when we took it out a corner was bent just enough to cause bleed over of the screen. Sent it back. Amazon did a fine job and this time it came in perfect condition. This unit is heavier than it looks and I would recommend you have two people handling it when you remove it from packaging. I was not concerned with sound at all from this unit as I have a surround sound system, which I would recommend to anyone buying a 55\\"" or larger tv. If you don't have surround sound with a home theater size television you are missing the whole experience.<br /><br />Pros:<br />  1. Ultra slim design<br />  2. Pivoting pedestal base lets you rotate tv easily around 30degrees either<br />  direction<br />  3. Easy hookup<br />  4. Price (and here in lies the biggest factor as I will explain)<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />  1. Internal Speakers<br />  2. Remote<br /><br />The pros: Very slim, this belies the weight though as it is heavy. The pivoting base is nice , if say you have dining room, great room open to each other. Say you are in the kitchen or something you can just turn the tv more to your angle while doing something and still see it. Hookup was easy for me, ONE HDMI cable and plug into current and I was in business. The price when I bought unit in October 2011 was only $1068. I felt that was reasonable based on my prior experience with Toshiba.<br />The cons: The only real cons to this set are the sound bar, which I don't use anyway. I will put it this way: If you are buying a 55\\"" TV and you expect to get great sound to fill a room from a tiny built in soundbar , then you need to check into the word \\"" surround \\"", as = Invest in a surround sound system, you will not regret it and that is the only way to rock with a big screen anyway, then you get the effects of your own movie theater. Which is kind of the whole point in getting a big screen tv.<br /><br />My conclusions are this:<br />Great set for the money! The color is great, but leave it on factory default settings.

We previously had a Cuisenart grind and brew, but pitched it when we remodeled our kitchen replacing it with this Breville. The Cuisinart made decent coffee, but it was loud, and horrible to clean. This Breville is leagues ahead in terms of flavor. It's probably a little quieter because it's a bur grinder, but you also have to set realistic decible expectations and take into account that its only grinding for a short time.  In terms of flavour and strength, this is the best coffee I have ever had from a home coffee maker.  I'm not even brewing the coffee on the strongest settings, but I'm tasting bold, strong coffee that is every bit as good as a cup of Starbucks. I'm not a super taster, but I am a discerning one and this really does brew an astonishingly good cup/carafe of coffee. As bonus, the machine is easy to clean (a lot easier than the Cuisinart). It is very easy to use, yet offers a lot of custom settings. I love being able to pour a whole bag of coffee beans in the hopper. And make single cups instead of a whole carafe. The carafe keeps the coffee hot for as long as any other thermal carafe I have owned. As far as I can tell, it does not possess any magic thermal dynamic powers. And, as many other review"

And buzzy.  In fact, I'd go as far as to say that it is downright unruly.  There is no chance you would use this in a bedroom even on low speed.  The controls were easy to use although not completely intuitive.  There are three speeds available on each fan - low, high and super high.  You have to set each fan separately, which I think is stupid.  I cannot imagine a scenario where I would want one fan on high and another fan on low, etc.  The temperature setting dial is also extremely stupid.  There are no temperature markings.  According to the manual, you are supposed to keep the unit on until the room reaches a temperature that you like and then turn the dial back until the unit cycles off.  Seriously?  Each fan has its own direction switch for either intake or exhaust.  The power cord is located on the bottom center of the front of the unit and its mounted too low so that it interferes with the bottom of my window frame.  Who is designing these things?  The one feature it had that I liked was that the grilles were directional and could be rotated to direct air in a 360 degree arc.  On the power consumption front, this unit used twice the power as the Holmes! - 97 watts on low, 109 watts on high and 120 watts on super high.  My unit was defective in that the switches for the right fan are wired incorrectly such that low is high and high is low, but super high is still super high... odd.  Returning.

642063,2351573,"got this unit used from a company that decided to go back to a wired network.  This device is usually not needed in a home network and I eventually found I did not need it.  All my computers are within a 50 foot range of the wireless router.  I did find that it did boost the signal, but it only showed up as a small percentage of gain, about 5 to 10 percent.  I think the gain would have been larger if a computer was beyond or near the edge of the wireless router's range.  There are two Linksys Wireless-G Range Expanders, both of them have the model number WRE54G, mine also has \\""version 2\\"" mentioned right after the model number.  The difference in the two is significant.  Version 2 has an ethernet port below the LED lights.  This makes autoconfiguration easy.  The other model needs to have the wireless security disabled in order for the \\""autoconfiguration\\"" button to work.  This one gives the option of just plugging in an ethernet connection to the router and then hitting \\""autoconfigure\\"", holding it until the red LED light turns on.  The ethernet cable bypasses the wireless security (both WEP and WPA).  This makes a potential headache disappear.  However, both of these WRE54G range extenders (version 1 and 2) were created before WPA encryption came out.  If the unit does not work, it might need a firmware update.  It may be possible to manually configure it, too, by going to the web browser (while the unit is on) and type the following URL: 192.168.1.240 I suspect without the right firmware, when the DCHP rotates that the unit might not update properly and you might need to the configure button every time it rotates (about every 15 to 30 minutes).

Went to B&D website for support, it told me that division was sold to Baccus Global.. went to their website, only units with jumper cables are listed.. not this unit or anything close to this unit.      So, I called Black and Decker.   They first asked if I turned it on when it was plugged in.  I don't think I did, but it would be a rather simple mistake.   She acted like I might have killed with such a simple action.  I said 'no'.  She said that it can't be fixed and I had to take to the local authorized service center for a replacement.   That service center was 25 miles out of my way.  I called the service center, they told me they would replace my hours old product with a refurb.. and by they way, they don't stock them so it may take 4-8 weeks.      I fiddled with the compressor and re-read both the paper instructions and the instructions at blackanddecker.com.   Note:  they were different (whatever that means).  The on-line version indicates you can inflate a tire without setting a max pressure whereas the printed manual didn't.        Regardless, I actually managed to get a non 'ERR' screen, and actually managed to get it in PSI instead of KpA.   I inflated exactly one motorcycle tire, and it worked flawlessly.  However, the battery, which did charge for 4-5 hours, was flashing that it was nearly dead after only one motorcycle tire.       I plugged it in (making sure the unit was turned off first so I didn't destroy it) and walked away.   Unplugged it, turned it on to see how it was, etc.   I got the infamous 'ERR' on the screen.  I turned it off and on several times until finally I did not get the 'ERR' display.  Cool... that's not that bad.  A little inconvenient, but hey, I can turn it off an on 10 times.  I hooked it up to a tire to get a reading and it read something like 700 KpA  I Don't deal with metric KpA, so I tried to switch to PSI.No luck.  I followed the instructions to the letter and hit the + and - keys at the same time.  I tried hitting them many times, holding them down for a while.... no luck.  Seems stuck in KPA forever.      I disconnected from the tire.  Turned the unit off, walked away for a while.  Unit is charged up, not plugged in, and not connected to a tire at this point.  Turn it back on, and it is taking a pressure reading of my garage of 770 KpA.              Bottom line:  This unit seems flaky (at best), and I'm at my wits end.  There is a 1 year warranty on the product from B&D, but I have decided to return the product and go with a simpler battery inflator with less bells and whistles.  I'd hate to think that if I hit the off/on button (not the compressor run button) while plugged in that I might freak this unit out.  I just get the feeling that if I got a new unit, and it worked perfectly, that it would flake out after 13 months.        Thanks to Amazon for treating customers better than the manufacturers do.   I have purchased hundreds of items at Amazon, and I believe this is my first return.   After dealing with B&D, I don't know if I'll ever buy a B&D product again.         One more thing:  If the air hose was 6 inches longer (like my old inflator), it would be much more useable (if you get one that's not flaky).  To get to a motorcycle tire over exhaust pipes, I had to hold the inflator in the air as the cord would not allow the unit to sit on the ground.           Sorry for such a long and 'sob story' review"

Some are more likely to get mushrooms (toad, toadette), some are more likely to get chain chomps (baby Mario / baby Luigi), giant shells (Bowser / Bowser Jr.), etc. By teaming up different characters, you can suit your own play style.<br /><br />You start with a standard assortment of characters / karts (plenty of variety) and through completing different races / grand prix / challenges, you can unlock additional characters / karts.<br /><br />Basically, this game is 5 kind of fun and is pretty much infinitely replayable. It's a great party game, since up to 4 players at a time can play and it's not too hard to pick up. Though mastering it can be an occasionally challenging pursuit.<br /><br />These days it's harder to come by, since it's not manufactured anymore but it's still popular for all the aforementioned reasons and it'll still play on the Wii (no idea if it'll play on the WiiU tho'; I don't think it supports GC controllers like the regular Wii did, so maybe not?).<br /><br />----------<br /><br />On another note.<br /><br />If you like this game, I'd also VERY HIGHLY recommend [[ASIN:B0007KTBAS Crash Tag Team Racing]].

The first thing I noticed after putting together the vac is it's solid build.  It's mainly made out of hard plastic and does not seem to damage very easily.  As mentioned, the vac comes with a handle to be able to maneuver it around areas much easier than those vacs that don't.  This is a very simple add on that more of these vacs should come with - it simply makes moving it around MUCH easier.<br /><br />Attached to the handle is a 'Roll Tight locking sleeve' which holds the accessories that come with the vac (a few different handles). Both the accessories and hose can store in this pouch.  I have yet to change the filter but it seems like quite an easy process.<br /><br />Performance<br />This vac is AMAZING.  Sad to say, but I currently live in a house which often has minor flooding.  My last vac did okay, but simply did not vacuum at a good rate.  The WorkShop vac is much more powerful (probably due to 6 vs. 4 HP of my old unit).  Also the fact this vac can hold 14 gallons makes it easy to get the job done in one trip.  If you need multiple trips, well - it's much easier to move the unit with a handle than without one.<br /><br />Overall, this product is great.

After reinstalling Windows and running a bunch of tests during 5 or 6 calls to HP, the unit continued to bluescreen during or soon after startup.  This is my second HP touchsmart PC (I also have the desktop, which had a defective dvd drive right out of the box) and I was disappointed in HP's inability to step up and replace this for me themselves.

They work on the assumption that the reason why young children pick up on languages and retain them so much better than adult do is because they are taught differently than adults.  Adults go to classes and learn grammer first etc...While children simply use the visual and audio ques around them and naturally absorb everything.  However this is FALSE & it's been proven to be false yet the company still feeds this nonsense to it's customers.    Even children born blind who do not have the ability for visual ques such as the movement of the lips or seeing objects and facial expressions pick up & retain language at a far superior level than adults with all 5 senses do.

Medium is just a bit too low and high is uncomfortable, so she settles for medium which ends up taking longer to finish (a med-hi setting would be perfect).<br /><br />Being a VERY male dominated workplace, her employer isn't exactly &#34;breast-pumping friendly&#34;, so she ends up having to use the ladies-room to do this, and she says the carry bag, the compact size of the unit, and the long hoses are very convenient in this situation. (At least they provided her with a comfortable chair to sit in while she pumps.)<br /><br />This is not a quiet device and she is put-off a bit about having to use it at work because &#34;you can hear it right outside the ladies-room&#34;, but it's a fairly noisy workplace so fortunately no one really seems to pay much attention, she says.<br /><br />She finds cleaning it to be: &#34;a pain in the butt&#34;, but also that: &#34;I guess it's not worse than any other breast pump to clean, I'm just EXHAUSTED from being a working mother!&#34;<br /><br />She's only been using it a week now and it's running perfectly, but one of the reasons I chose this brand was the EXCELLENT customer support that Philips gives for the Advent system.

756335,3310028,"get the product out of the packaging. We found that the helicopter came out of the box with some charge to it, but we went ahead and charged it anyway, after about 20 minutes of putting batteries into the pieces and reading the instructions, we were ready to fly.<br /><br />For the helicopter, we were pretty impressed with the control. You have to be gentle with the throttle, and I can see how that might be difficult for some kids, but really it's just a matter of learning the controls. We had the trim properly adjusted within about 10 minutes, and were steadily flying shortly after that. I've never flown any of the really high dollar rc helicopters before, but I was quite amazed with the level of control that this offered. Contrary to the included instructions, we were playing in a rather cramped living room with tons of obstructions. Within an hour of playing with it, we were successfully able to take off, navigate through the rooms of our home, and land on a pre-determined space. We did encounter some control issues when flying near a running fan, open window, or anywhere where our home had a draft. Air currents can certainly blow the helicopter around. We experienced about 20 minutes of constant flight before the battery started to drain and performance slowed, then about 5 minutes more play before we couldn't achieve flight at all. We crashed the copter 40 or 50 times, and it always came out of the crashes beautifully, working just as well as before.<br /><br />Overall I think we would have gotten a good deal for the price, just with the helicopter, but the really fun part of this set is the tracking missile battery. It's got two modes, one where it automatically tracks the helicopter, and one where a second player can control the missiles. When you start it up, it's \\""eyes\\"" light up and it announces itself in a deep robotic voice that had us cracking up. One review"

774069,48327,"got this product suite. There is only about $25 difference between this suite and PowerDVD by itself. So with all these other products in this suite of applications, it is obviously an extremely good deal compared to PowerDVD alone.  Power Producer is easily worth that much difference in price by itself.  CyberLink should change the name to make it much more obvious that PowerDVD is included. I would never have purchased PowerDVD 12 Ultra if I had known about Media Suite 10 Ultra. They should at least call it CyberLink Suite 12 Ultra so it doesn't sound like it is an old out-of-date version. If I were their marketing manager, I would change all the products to version 12.<br /><br />I was very surprised how remarkably similar their Power Director video editing software is to Pinnacle Studio 16. It is so much the same that I had no difficulty using Power Director at all. Some of menus are a little different, but not by much. It is very much the same look and feel.

786953,1596230,"get a unit that takes both the large size CO2 tank or the small one (like this one) - that way you at have options (which I discuss below under CO2 tanks). I really prefer the larger tanks so I don't have to refill as often. However, they are more of a pain to store and lug to a retailer to exchange (or box up and carry to post office if doing mail exchange...), and some retailers only carry the smaller tanks for exchange. If you don't drive,your local retailers only have the small tanks or you have lifting issues then the smaller tanks maymake more sense.<br /><br />CO2 Tanks:<br /><br />Where I live, Sur La Table is the closest source to buy and exchange the CO2 tanks, and they ONLY exchange the small ones. In fact, the lady there claims all the retailers except Costco only do the small bottles. Well, I've not been to every retailer to confirm this, but I do know that bed bath & beyond also exchanges the 130 litre tanks as well as the smaller 60 litre. It would be a real bummer if most all the local stores only exchanged the small tanks, but even if so, I'd still want the option to fit the large tanks too. The reason being is that you can always order them directly, and, if you're willing to chance the paintball tanks and refills, there is a gadget you can get that will adapt your soda stream connector to fit those kinds of refillable tanks: SodaMod SodaStream Soda-Club CO2 Adapter - Save Money on Refills- Made in the USA- 100% Guarantee it's expensive up front, but if you use your soda maker as often as I do the cost for the device would be paid off in just a couple of months or less. Those who use the paint ball refillable tanks (which are about 120 liters from what I understand) claim they can refill them for only $5.00 (which is obviously much less than the tank exchange cost of a soda stream tank).<br /><br />Flavors:<br /><br />I can't say anything about the flavors/syrups as I don't use any of that stuff - I only like unflavored super sparkly water. Although it does seem most of the mixes have ingredients I wouldn't want to serve to my family, so you might want to look at that if it's a consideration.<br /><br />Problems I've encountered over my 8+ years using soda stream:<br /><br />1. There've been times that I've encountered some sort of quality issues in the past, and that's usually when I've quit using the system for awhile (but I always go back within 6-9 months or so...). for awhile I was having bottles that didn't hold their fizz - I think there may have been a year or so the bottles just weren't as well made or something. I've also had times where I could've sworn my tanks had about 1/2 the gas they were suppposed to have (again, this was a few years back, and this seems to have been fully resolved).<br /><br />2. If you live somewhere really hot it doesn't seem to work as well. But again, I don't pre-chill my water, so this likely would be resolved if your water is pre-chilled.<br /><br />3. My soda stream fizzy water goes flat much sooner than Perrier, but about the same as other sparkling waters. Perrier is naturally carbonated, so this may make the difference. However, it doesn't seem to go flat any sooner than the artificially carbonated store bought waters such as Calistoga.<br /><br />4. If you don't like the taste of your tap water, you won't like the taste of it sparkling either. There is definitely a taste difference between Perrier and my soda stream sparkling water. The last place we lived I quit using my soda stream because the water there just tasted funky. However, we recently moved (thus, I acquired another soda stream maker) and here I really enjoy the taste. Some taste aspects can be filtered out with a water filter, but not all - it's pretty much trail and error to figure that one out.<br /><br />The bottles:<br /><br />1. Cleaning - I really, really, really wish I could dishwash the bottles. I use both the 1 litre and 1/2 liter bottles. The smaller ones I carry around and drink directly out of as if it were my bottle of Perrier I was carrying around (you're picking up on the fact that I love perrier, eh?). So because I'm drinking directly from these they get funky sooner (human mouths are much more contaminated than that of your dog or cat - that's why human bites can be terrible for infections, so just imagine all that on the edge of your bottle...). I then use the larger bottle for refilling my small ones in a pinch, or for serving folks that come around and want some sparkles. Hand cleaning the threads and lid of the small ones before each fill isn't too terrible, but I'd feel better about it if they had the intense cleaning of my dishwasher.<br /><br />2. The 1/2 liter bottles - I love, love the size of the 1/2 litre bottles. However, I've encountered something on the 1/2 litre bottles I've never had happen before on any other of my Soda stream bottles. I have the orange and green bottles, and between the colored part on the bottom and the clear plastic there is a line of mold about 1 cm down from the top of where the colored plastic piece sits. I think the colored plastic piece is a tad too bit at the top, allowing water and microbes to get in, then it has a super tight seal about 1 cm down and the microbes move in and set up shop right at the point where the plastic is too tight for them to go down further (see the picture I uploaded). While this isn't getting into the water I drink, it is really gross. I've ordered another set in a different color and we'll see if it happens with those 1/2 litre bottles as well. My larger ones are all just fine, but they're too big to carry around, so I hope this issue can be sorted out. I suppose on the larger bottles with the black plastic this may be happening and it just isn't visible because the plastic is black. However, my current larger bottles are gray and they do not have this mold issue.<br /><br />Competing products:<br /><br />Primo & Cuisinart:<br /><br />There are other systems out there for less money and that allow use of the paintball refillable tanks. However, many end up being fly-by-night, going out of business or being bought up by other companies (such as Primo Primo Flavorstation FSS Liberty 120 (Black) being bought by Cuisinart and no longer being made or supported by the manufacturer).<br /><br />Cuisinart Cuisinart SMS-201 Sparkling Beverage Maker-Includes 4 oz. CO2 Cartridge (Metallic Red) + 2 Pcs 10oz ARC Handy Glass Coffee Mug + Accessory Kit is new to the game and their tanks are smaller than the small 60 litre tanks for the soda stream (and they have poor review"

The product is thick and not watery like some other conditioners. This can be both good and bad. I do find that conditioners that are a bit more watery are easier to apply to my hair. That's not to say this product wasn't. It just took a bit more time to apply because I work in sections with my hair and need a bit more product for full coverage. Once I get my hair coated, it doesn't just sit on top of it, it does mix nicely with my hair.<br /><br />Does it work: Yes, sorta. What I mean by this is that for my hair texture I need a little more than 3 minutes because I don't feel like its enough for full penetration especially as a stand alone product. (I usually deep condition with a hair steamer) As the product says sit for 2 mins and 45 secs, rinse then go. Unfortunately for me thats impossible, because my hair will not cooperate that way. I did notice that after incorporating this deep conditioner in my hair care routine, that my hair was noticeably softer and a bit more manageable. But I have to follow up with the L.O.C (leave-in, oil, cream) method with styling to keep my hair in a manageable state. I also noticed when styling for going out, that it was easier to manipulate my hair, I have a decrease in breakage (after 2.5 weeks of use), and I had a bit more shine with more curl definition and less fizzing.<br /><br />Conclusion: It is definitely worth trying because no two individuals are the same. Of course what it did or didn't do for me, may or maynot be the same results for you. But I will make this product apart of my hair routine because I was satisfied with my results.<br /><br />#Gotitfree"

815469,728488,"get opportunities which are essentially missions to undertake with rewards of money and other things tangible or intangible. These combined with random events (like grill-offs, or chess tournaments) are designed to get you out there interacting with other sims and advancing your sim. In the end, what happens is all up to you.    Your sims can eventually die (though you can turn this off)so you'll likely want to look at starting a family and progressing your family tree. This essentially means, the death of one character isn't the end of the game.     Now, this isn't a traditional RPG so you have to keep in mind that there are moments of boredom where you wait for something to happen (really that's only when your sim is at work). You can speed up time but for things like work, you're sitting around for a couple minutes waiting. Not terrible but it can become a drag at times. This combined with the needs for your sim (hunger, energy, etc.) which without help from lifetime rewards (rewards paid for with points you accumulate living your life) can sometimes leave you in a time management crunch. It's one of those things that you learn to deal with as you play but it can become tiresome after a while. Consider yourself warned.    There's also a huge community of people tossing up items, sims, and the like on the Sims Exchange online. EA's also got a store where you can buy more items, sims, lots, etc. for a price. The average item will cost you anywhere from 25-100 sim points. The exchange rate is $1 = 100 sim points. You can buy more points on the site. Just keep in mind that the bread and butter of this franchise is expansion packs and stuff packs which add features and content to the game every 6-9 months. You can either stash cash for these packs or just microtrans your way into a new car or new set of furniture that your sims can eventually buy.    All in all, though, the game is fun. There are interesting interactions and sometimes surprises. You have a lot of free"

This product has been on the market for more than a few years so I was kind of disappointed that my PuP also had the chest-plate fabric curling issue.  I worked in the manufacturing industry for twenty years I was irritated that 'Quality Control' processes were not put in place to correct this defect.  I was further irritated at the adhesive resistance of the combination of the fabric and underlying rubber padding.  The red fabric insisted on curling and I grew tired of constantly having to press it back down.  Finally I just duct taped both the offending 'repairs' in place to secure them long enough for the adhesive to set.  Ihave attached pictures of the 'repair'.  I will update this review

If you have no other way to get Amazon Instant Video and must have it, this player is not for you at this time, and may never be according to others. My only complaint, and a small one at that, is that it takes a bit of loading time to show the files on my HDD.

879957,1450536,"got this product today so can't evaluate the optics or the motions.  I mainly bought the telescope for the mount.  What I can say about the mount is that it is okay - a little bigger than I expected.  One thing I don't like is that you need an electrical source in order to move this thing (you can't move it otherwise).  It comes with a direct current (cigerrete) power cord as well as an AC 2 prong adapter.  The 3x barlow looks like junk, but I haven't tested it so can't say for sure.  The eyepieces come in eyepiece bolts and suspect they are your regular standard plossls. The hand control plugs in one of two USB ports.  One port is for the slewing and tracking and the other says it is for focus (although I don't see how you can focus a telescope from a mount - maybe they mean some sort of refinement of movement). <br />Another thing is that the tube comes with 2 caps - one covering the front of the scope and one over the mirror.  Apparently the one over the mirror is very loose and suspect it won't stay on. <br />You do get a lot for your money.  You get a finder (somewhere between the size of a telrad and that of a rigel finder), 2 eyepieces, telescope, 2 batteries, barlow, and of course mount.  That is one thing I like about this product.  The telescope tube also looks nice with it's silverish whitish finish.  <br />I did test the slew function of the telescope and it seems fine.  The hand control is not as refined as a nexstar 5 hand control, but I guess if you're only spending this much you can't be too picky.  It just might take a while for it to slew to the object you want to as it is not too fast, but it isn't really slow either. <br />A good deal for your money - just don't expect too much from it.  I'd probably give this 3.5 stars if I could mainly because I find the inability to slew without electricity annoying.  It means that you'll have to take a power source with you if you plan on observing in the middle of no where. <br />It looks like you cancolliminate the tube with 3 screws in the back on the mirror plate and some front screws for the secondary.  Suspect that collimination won't be hard at this long focal length.  Focuser looks cheap but adequate.  Overall I like the tube, but am iffy on the mount. <br />Maybe I'll update the review"

900164,1003349,"sential items I needed to buy before I could completely transform to using a safety razor.  A decent quality shaving brush was one such item.  The ESCALI 100% PURE BADGER SHAVING BRUSH proved to be the answer.<br /><br />WHAT IT IS:<br /><br />- Affordably priced, badger-hair shaving brush with a wood handle.<br /><br />WHY PURCHASE A SHAVING BRUSH?<br /><br />- After decades of spraying gel into my hand to apply shaving cream, I never really gave shaving brushes a thought.  Using a shaving brush always seemed as nothing more than adding an expensive degree of sophistication to a rather mundane task (like using silk instead of toilet paper).  Once I started using a shaving brush, I immediately saw the benefits.<br /><br />- First of all, applying shaving cream with a brush simply feels better than using your hand as it messages the cream into your skin and helps generate a decent lather with little effort.  Brushing a warm layer of shaving soap on your skin adds a level of enjoyment to the shaving ritual.<br /><br />- A decent shaving brush can retain enough soap and liquid to allow several applications without having to “reload”.  Using a brush, you can get more use from a smaller amount of soap/cream.<br /><br />WHY BADGER AND WHY ESCALI?<br /><br />- I’ve read several articles and review"

903337,241986,"get the unit I received to work acceptably. I carefully read the instructions, and was trying to get it to work with my Sony HD handycam, which is a really nice video camera. I often film subjects speaking some distance from the camera, so really needed a good remote microphone.<br /><br />I am sorry to say that I could not get this unit to work properly. I was able to connect the receiver to the camera through the provided cable, and was able to get the receiver and transmitter to properly sync up with each other. The issue was the sound quality. The volume was very low, and there was a significant hiss. I followed instructions to set the unit on highest volume using the multi function switch. The volume was still very low and significant hiss. I was careful to have the lin/mic switch in the proper position, and careful to have the 0/-15 dB switch in the proper position. In fact, I even tried wrong switch settings to see if I could stumble upon a setting that would give crisp audio.<br /><br />In the end nothing worked. Since the receiver and transmitter appeared to be working properly, and I confirmed that the supplied cable was working properly, my best guess is that it is likely an issue with the microphone, the microphone cord, or microphone connector. Unfortunately, it is a non-standard microphone, so I am unable to trouble shoot further, since my standard microphones will not work with this unit.<br /><br />I am disappointed to have to give this a bad review"

907331,1100632,"got the unit and really went through the manual (and verified after hooking it up), is that it will not turn on and begin heating water until the flow rate is greater than ~0.25 GPM (gallons per minute).  Now, that's water flow on the hot water line - not total water flow.  So, even if you turned your faucet all the way to hot, you'd have to have at least 0.25 GPM of flow before the heater would start to heat up the water.  If you had the faucet at the midpoint between hot and cold, you'd need 0.5 GPM of total flow...and so on.  I included an example table in the video to show this for one set of temperatures.  I think this is definitely something to consider if you want warm (not hot) water at lower flow rates sometimes or occasionally use a trickle of hot water like I do to wash some things.<br /><br />(*) NOT \\""INSTANT\\"" HOT WATER<br />A whole-house tankless heater is different from a point-of-use heater like what you'd install under a sink.  Any delay that you have now in waiting for water to get hot at your faucet is going to be the same with this versus a tank, assuming that you install this in the same location as your current tank.  Might sound like common sense, but some folks that I've talked to about this just have a mental impression about tankless heaters being instant hot water, so I'm pointing it out.  The delays in water getting hot at your faucet are caused by flushing out the water already in the lines when you turn on the faucet, along with some level of heating up the water pipes so they aren't cooling off the water much on it's way to the faucet.  Tank or tankless, that still happens.  If you want essentially instant hot water, a point-of-use heater is the way to go.<br /><br />(*) INSTALLATION<br />It should go without saying, but either get a certified plumber and electrician to do the install, or have your work inspected to make sure that it meets code in your area.  You can void the warranty on the unit if you don't.<br /><br />MY ECO 36 IMPRESSIONS<br />-----------------------------<br />Overall, I'm impressed by the build quality, ease of installation (once you have the electrical lines in place), and customer service.<br /><br />(*) HARDWARE DESIGN AND BUILD QUALITY:  5 Stars<br />I'm not a professional plumber, but the workmanship looks very good and solid to me.  The external case is well made, and it's easy to get the cover off to work on this inside.  Everything on the inside is laid out neatly and assembled cleanly.  The heating elements are designed to unscrew for removal and replacement if needed, which is nice and prevents you from having to replace the entire unit if one goes bad.<br /><br />Hook up of the electrical lines is straightforward and easyto do.  Just three locations to insert wires and tighten a screw to secure them for each 40A line (two \\""hot\\"" wires and a ground wire).  The screw-down locations for the wires are located right by the opening in the case for the wires, and the case comes with a strain-relief clamp.  I had no issues securing the wires or adjusting the strain relief on my unit.<br /><br />Hooking up the water lines couldn't be much easier.  The one thing that I would have liked to have seen was more area on the outside of the case to grip the pipes as I secured the water lines to prevent putting stress on the internal components in the heater.  There was plenty of area right inside the case to grip those pipes, but it means that the lid had to be off to properly properly secure the water lines.  No biggie, and the only nit on installation that I had.<br /><br />(*) CONTROL PANEL DESIGN: 4 Stars<br />As far as water heaters go, it's probably more like 5 stars.  It's very easy to operate and to read, and you can't really mess anything up - you either turn it on/off or you adjust the temperature set point.  Very straightforward.<br /><br />I took one star away because of what I wish they had included, which is the ability to see some of the parameters being monitored by the controller.  I'd really like to see a read out of the current water flow rate, the incoming water temperature, the outgoing water temperature, and the power draw.  They wouldn't need to add another display, either, but just some way to toggle that info (like a separate, smaller button).  I know folks wouldn't use that often, but it would probably be easy to do and would be really helpful when doing diagnostic work and when first setting it up.<br /><br />(*) CUSTOMER SERVICE:  5 Stars<br />So far, five stars in my book.  I sent an inquiry about installation via their website e-mail late in the day on Christmas Eve, and I received a response the morning after Christmas.  They first attempted to call me, and when I didn't get to the phone in time, the rep left me a voice mail with information and call back numbers, and then almost immediately sent an e-mail with a detailed answer to my question.  He answered my question thoroughly, and I was quite pleased.  I have not had to contact them about any problems with the unit, so I don't know that part of their service.<br /><br />A (VERY) LITTLE MATH<br />--------------------------<br />Ecosmart provides some good examples of capacity, but their diagram on this page doesn't include the ECO 36 as of my review"

908245,1068725,"got the product for use on an outdoor plastic shed that gets mildew easily.  I cleaned the shed first using bleach, allowed it to dry, then applied the 303 product as instructed on the instructions.  However, be aware that the warning about too much of it can drip and run, and that it needs to be wiped and dried immediately, is entirely a non-issue.  There is a 2nd set of instructions that just continues from the first set, pertaining to either a spray or liquid application (can't tell which, but clearly they switched to liquid application, not the moist towelettes).  It says that excess product might be a problem with liquid, therefore it has to be wiped and dried immediately.  The moist towelettes in this container could hardly be accused of being too saturated.  If anything, I was a bit unimpressed with the limited amount of product actually in each towelette.  I actually ended up using four different towelettes for the first section I did  as a test (something less than two square feet).  At that rate, the product is not going to last long at all, making it a very UNeconomical product to use for something as relatively non-critical as an outdoor shed.  There are only 40 towelettes measuring 7&#34;x8&#34; in the container.  I expect that once I get done with the entire shed, I'll have used a minimum of half the container (probably nearly all of it).  I'm not convinced that I'd want to spend either the Amazon price or the listed retail price just to keep an outdoor shed mildew free"

910941,1452188,given this product only 2 stars but am changing my mind.  I am updating to 4 stars because I found I still needed a range extender in my basement even with the new router due to intermittent signal loss.  Since I reset this device to pick up the new router so far I haven't had any issues.  It does allow me to get uninterrupted internet access in our basement and hasn't slowed down the internet access in other areas of the house.  Another note is that previously I was trying to use two of these devices at the same time.  I am not sure but I think this caused some of the issues I was experiencing.  I couldn't find any information anywhere on the product website as to whether you can use two of these at the same time. So far with a properly functioning router and using just one device in our basement this device seems to work as expected. I am holding back from 5 stars as it is not easy to reset these devices.  It's hit or miss on whether the software interface will load that allows you to sync them to your router.  It normally takes two or three tries of entering the supplied IP address for the wireless range extender to get the software interface to show up.<br /><br />Orignal review

915004,3382252,"get the unit to fly in a circle around him then move forward a few feet before it finally keeled over and dropped to the ground. Once. Other efforts were somewhat problematic.<br /><br />First things first - the remote control takes 6 AA batteries. These are used not only to power the control unit but to charge the Air Hog through a wired connection. The charge takes less than half an hour. You then turn on both the Air Hog and the remote and start moving. To move on the ground, the rotors are spun up to half speed or so and the unit works well bouncing along the floor or other hard surface. It will not work on grass or similar exterior surface, though hard dirt is fine. I'd recommend against efforts to use the unit inside. Unless you have a hotel ballroom as a living space, the Air Hog will quickly run out of room. It moves fast. But you can use it outside only on a completely calm day - any efforts to fly with windy conditions will fail at once.<br /><br />We pushed the button for the Air Hog to hop or fly. This button works sometimes, and not others. After a day of play, we have yet to figure out why it doesn't always work - essentially the button increases the full throttle response to 100% instead of about 50%, thereby taking the unit off. Do this briefly and the unit hops - keep it going and the Air Hog flies. And flies well if it doesn't first hit the ceiling (inside) or fly up 80' in the air and out of range of the remote (outside presumably). Adjusting the throttle is easier said than done so we're hoping to get better at that as time passes.<br /><br />Turning right or left, on the ground or in the air, works quite well and our unit required no trim adjustment, although this is provided on the remote panel. The ship carries four yellow missiles which can be launched with a special launch button on the remote. This works perfectly, though aiming is not easy. Small targets are provided. They are about the size of an old silver dollar. I couldn't do it. I was, however, able to hit the side of my house repetitively while holding the Air Hog in my hand and aiming at my home. Doing this while flying is another story.<br /><br />Flying the unit inside is recommended by the manufacturer but to get good enough for this, you'll spend some time watching it crash into the ceiling, walls, cat, and any other objects that happen to be nearby. Luckily the Air Hog is sturdy and appears able to tolerate this type of abuse. We were happier testing"

Maybe I just don't know the Genie software well enough, but I need to know when attached devices drop off the network, and when internet access is lost.    AUGUST 2014 Update- well, the drops continued and a Comcast service visit found the cable signal to be good.  The tech could not find a problem, so I got charged $60 for a service call.  That was the last straw- I don't know if Comcast's signal is dropping or if I got a second bad Netgear unit, and had no way to figure it out.  I switched to ATT Uverse and have been very happy so far- no internet drops whatsoever in a week and the wireless signal from the Motorola NVG589 modem-router-wireless radio actually covers the entire house, better than my Netgear WNDR 3700 or WNDR 3800 or C3700 ever did. However, for those of you really tired of wireless problems, I heartily recommend you think about using a commercial-grade wireless access point by a vendor such as Ubiquiti.  I have been fighting poor wireless coverage for years and I'm ready to shell out some money for quality equipment.  I have a Ubiqiti access point on its way from Amazon.Once I get it installed, I'll do a review"

I follow the directions and could not get the website to recognize the gps. When I tried to download the software from magellan it would start downloading but would not be on the computer after it was done. I thought that I would enter the coordinates and look for the cache near my house and see how it would do. The unit would lose signal in my city for no reason and it took 4-5 minutes to get the signal established again. When I used it it would say that I was moving when I stood still and the compass would spin in circles when it would say I was 85 ft away. I didn't know which direction to walk!!<br /><br />This gps is terrible. I wish it would have been what it says because my son was so excited to give it to me.

Our current microwave (a GE over-the-stove vent fan/microwave/convection oven Model JVM-1190BY) has seen better days, taking 40-minutes to get up to temperature and not cooking evenly. While it cannot replace the GE's position (only a vent hood can do that - BTW: I do not recommend combining a vent hood with a cooking appliance... grease gets everywhere and cleaning it out is problematic, and it's constantly dripping from various places over the stove!), the AX-1200S can do better (much better!!) in the microwave/convection oven application, plus it does steaming!<br />I completely agree with Nuknuk that the LCD info/interface screen does everything ergonomically. I'm one of those people who actually read the manual when I get something as complex and/or potentially dangerous as a microwave/convection/steaming oven. So, I read the manual. There's loads of info in there, much of which doesn't apply to me as I don't do automatic cooking and do not need new recipes. However, the info on manually using the appliance was worth reading - once. Now, it's just a matter of following the on-screen instructions.

You won't get an Emmy award for a movie filmed with this but it's good enough for impressing your neighbors and boy-/girlfriends. The mounting needs some design improvements. The buttons feel stiff and do not have the same quality that Sony once was known for. After all, this camera is made in China. The clear case (waterproof housing) provides some protection to the camera but it could induce more distortion of both audio and video recording. Also, it's not scratch resistant and once the lens surface on the case is scratched, picture quality suffers!<br /><br />The remote control also has very short battery life.

What this means is that when I'm using my BulletCam, the cam is sitting in my waist pack and the A/V cable is sticking straight out of the port instead of being a right angle. Sticking out like that is VERY annoying.  It's hard to pack and easier to get tugged out of the port.<br /><br />Now there are four items that need mentioning:<br /><br />1.  12x Optical/480x Digital Zoom<br /><br />I'm pleased with the zoom, it works very well, it has variable zooming speeds that it easy to use and the cam focuses well as it's zooming.  But why is it that both lower models have better zoom than this model?  HC21 & HC32 comes with 20x800x zoom, and this one comes with only 12x480x?  So even though the zoom itself works well, I feel a little ripped off.<br /><br />2.  TouchScreen<br /><br />I like that the cam has few buttons on the outside.  This prevents accidental buttons getting pushed when I'm using my BulletCam.  It also keeps the cam looking sleek and clean.  But I don't like that you have to use the touchscreen.  I don't like that the LCD gets all these fingersmudges on it, I don't like HAVING to use the touchscreen to access features and modes.  The touchscreen itself is easy for me to use, but I also have small fingers/fingertips - I wonder what a big guy with big hands thinks of having to tap the touchscreen all the time.  In order to record from the AV Input, I have to use the touchscreen to get to the REC CNTRL mode - this is extremely inconvenient and made it necessary for me to purchase a $70.00 remote to bypass that.

If you're buying a camcorder, focus on it's performance as a camcorder and don't worry about the Still-Shot feature.

It's now okay to ship a half-baked product, solicit tons of input from early adopting customers, and offer frequent firmware updates to fix major and minor flaws.<br /><br />Which brings me to the reason I purchased this product: I knew the MOTOACTV v1 would not be a flawless device but it had the features I wanted at a price (on Amazon) that I thought was reasonable.  I debated waiting untilv2, but I decided to buy this model because I recognized that most of the flaws could be fixed with firmware updates and Motorola appears committed to listening to users and releasing frequent updates.  They have already released multiple firmware updates over the past few months (with a preference for the 8GB model, so be wary of the 16GB), including one just before I bought it that fixed the battery life issues.  Since battery life was one of the primary complaints from early users, it was essential that they corrected that issue.  In addition, they have a forum manager named Matt who is trolling all of the comments on this site and others and is frequently responding directly to customers.  I appreciate that, even if he can't fix every issue.<br /><br />In sum, this is not a perfect product, but I love the combination of features and the fact that it's getting better with each firmware update.  Using the MOTOACTV is SOOO much better than lugging around my bulky mobile phone on long runs! As long as Motorola continues the level of support that they have shown during the first few months of this product's life cycle, I would definitely recommend purchasing this device.<br /><br />------------<br />January 14, 2012 Update<br /><br />I've been running with the MOTOACTV for over two weeks and have logged ~80 miles with it.

Research on GMOs of great concern to consumers includes the following: Human studies have demonstrated that GMO crops, such as soy and corn, contain genes that can transfer into the essential bacteria in the human digestive system, causing them to do the same thing these genes cause their host plants to do--produce toxic pesticides. This finding helps explain why laboratory studies in which animals are fed GMO foods over a long period of time develop organ damage, gastrointestinal and immune system disorders, accelerated aging, and infertility.o crops to kill weeds, and the ability of the plant to produce its own insecticide. There were supposed to be other benefits, including crops with enhanced nutrition, increased yield and drought resistance--but to date, little evidence of these promised benefits has been produced. In the U.S., the government has approved GMOs based on studies conducted by the same corporations that create them and profit from their sale, such as Monsanto and Dow. Unfortunately, these corporations have a vested interest in never allowing any negative results of lab testing"

1075246,2497791,"given product, thereby increasing profits for the company using it. In the U.S., most of the time it is derived from rice, corn, or potato starch. Through a process called hydrolysis, the starch is reduced to its basic amino acids. Then an enzyme is used to break it down even further, resulting in a powder that instantly dissolves in water. People who are allergic to gluten should be aware that maltodextrin can sometimes be derived from barley or wheat. Per the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act (FALCPA), all FDA-regulated food products that contain maltodextrin derived from wheat must include the word \\""wheat\\"" on the food label. In the case of USDA-regulated foods (meat, poultry, and egg products), this warning is not required on the label, so beware of products such as soups with meat in them which say they contain maltodextrin. However, products such as jams and jellies--and a powdered product such as this one--which contain maltodextrin, are required by law to say \\""wheat\\"" in the the nutrition labeling if the maltodextrin is derived from wheat. The label of this productstates specifically that this product does not contain wheat, so hopefully this is true, and the manufacturer is in compliance with FALCPA.<br /><br />Dextrin: This is a white, yellow or brown powder produced from starch by interaction with heat, acid or enzymes. In the US, it's usually made from corn, potato, arrowroot, rice or tapioca--though people who are allergic to gluten should be aware it can also be derived from barley or wheat. It is partially or fully water-soluble, The food industry uses white dextrin to bind ingredients together, as a thickening agent and in coatings and glazes. The same FALCPA rules apply about labeling.<br /><br />Oat fiber: Plant fiber derived from oats. For people extremely sensitive to gluten, there is this possible danger: there have been many cases of inadvertent gluten contamination in factories that use wheat or barley products by such products accidentally getting into the oats. Unfortunately, unlike for nuts, apparently there are currently no requirements under FALCPA that force manufacturers to warn consumers if their factories also process wheat and barley products that might cross-contaminate oats.<br /><br />Acacia gum: Acacia gum is also known as acacia Senegal, acacia vera, chaar gund, char goond, meska, Egyptian thorn, gummi africanum, gum Senegal, gummae mimosae, kher, Sudan gum arabic, Somali gum, and yellow thorn. It is derived from the hardened sap of the acacia tree, which grows wild in Senegal, Sudan, Somalia and Arabia. It is used in the food industry as a stabilizer and thickening agent and in pharmaceuticals as a demulcent to heal inflamed skin or topical wounds. It inhibits the growth of periodontic bacteria which create plaque. In a clinical study, 15 grams of acacia gum per day was shown to reduce cholesterol.<br /><br />Tapioca flour: This is a starchy, slightly sweet, white powder derived from the root of the cassava plant, which is native to Brazil but is cultivated and used worldwide as a thickening agent in foods. It is gluten-free"

However, if you are a silly person, try Bose - they may be the company for you.  The first thing I did when I got these was drop them on the floor - and it broke. Not the headphones - the floor.

Their products are always upper-tier priced and though you will hear some people say--not the majority--that their products are 'pseudo-elite' or the 'layman's premium products' they have stayed around for a long time. Their products are usually, at the minimum, much above average quality. Some choices from them have been made on some products that have resulted in less than spectacular construction or functions not always working at the 'premium' level however one thing always remained: their sound quality was very good, especially the mids and highs.<br /><br />Critics will find it very difficult to find fault with the Bose SoundLink Mini. The price is of no mention for there is no competition with the Bose because the Mini can be compared, pretty well, with full size dock units price 300$ and above (from personal experience).<br /><br />[---Review"

1088325,2464400,"got this item from Amazon and on the webpage, it showed a unit with three led lights as a flashlight.  This one only has one.  And the cables to charge phones, etc don't look like those in the picture or in the manual itself.  The cables with all of the attachment points for different phones are all connected to one USB plug.  I looks like a ponytail with funky ends.  And again, I can't say enough about the construction.I'm pretty sure this thing will break with a few usages but then again, this is an emergency use radio.  I tried to connect my phone to the correct looking charger cable and . . .I couldn't get it in.  That end was made so thickly that it couldn't squeeze past the case I have the phone in.  Since this is the only device I plan on charging with it the radio I was a little disappointed. Just for kicks, I did use that cable with my computer and it charges the phone through my laptop but it doesn't recognize it to sync with the computer.<br />The second cable that is is suppose to come with is a USB to mini USB.  It's not.  I don't know what that cable is but it's a USB to a female end for something else.  And here is the cincher.  You can't charge your phone using the hand crank.  If you look at the picture of where the hand crank is and the USB port, the hand crank cannot go completely around while it's plugged in.  Yeah, I could crank the thing to charge the battery and then plug in the phone but it was still a surprise when I discovered this.<br /><br />I really thought I got the wrong item until I looked at the box.  There it was in pale orange/red: WR-334A-U.  Hmm.<br /><br />There is another issue.  I ordered two additional batteries to go with this item.  What can I say?  I had confidence that this was a good item to own and I like to be prepared.  When I connected the charger, the little red light lit up indicating that the battery was charging.  Ok.  I waited awhile and it turned green.  Great!  I popped in the next one.  I charged up pretty quickly, it took a little over an hour.  So I popped in the third and that one took awhile longer which made me suspicious.  Just for kicks I popped the &#34;charged&#34; batteries back in.  It lit up red.  So I turned the battery a little in the case and it turned green.  I took it out and put it back in, red.  I'm not kidding.  The same thing happened to the second one.  It turned red but it didn't turn green. I'm stillwaiting for the second one to stop &#34;charging&#34; and it's been about an hour so far.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this thing.

If you try to pull on the hose, as you would have to do to move from the front tire to the rear tire, the air compressor would move with it and often topple. Well, if the air compressor moves forward, it usually pulls on the power cables, detaching the clamps from the battery terminals. If the air compressor topples, which it usually does, it twists the power cable, also detaching the clamps from the battery.    * The power cable is too short.    * The tire chuck's lever is a bit too hard to squeeze.

The software interface wasn't exactly what I wanted, but I figure that's something that Logitech can work out.  Now that I've changed my tv and added a device I cannot use the Link anymore and customer service has been unable to fix my problem as of this writing.  It all began with the changes, which need to be synced to the iPad application.  When I first made the changes, I would go into the app and it would give me a message that said I made changes and I need to sync.  So, I would click on sync, at which point it would say it couldn't find changes to sync.  Closing and restarting the application did not fix this.  Uninstalling and reinstalling the application did not fix this.  Resetting the link did not fix this.  I reset the link and uninstalled and reinstalled the app and now I can't even get into the app.  It would not let me get into the app because it needs to sync first and every time it would try to sync it would fail.  I thought that perhaps the link didn't like my wireless security, so I removed that, which didn't help.  So, I decided to contact Logitech.  They basically told me to do the same things that I've been doing and to reset my wireless connection and reboot my computer.  Obviously, that didn't help.  The next thing they told me to do was to set up a dummy email address and start from scratch.  I just did that today and I'm still unable to sync.  It's saying \\""Unable to sync.

I am often using this by myself, and am old enough to need reading glasses... which I don't wear when I'm driving. The fonts could be larger in places, and with less white space.<br />2. The suction cup mount still isn't quite right. I liked when they added the twist-attach suction cup thing. And I see why they made it attached to the device, because I lost the mount for my second GPS. But this one doesn't suck up enough air to hold tightly enough, and then, of course, it falls off when you're driving (I usually attach to the plastic disk on my dash).<br />3. As for the software. I don't like that they have a model of one GPS unit per account. I have had to make multiple accounts with different email addresses, and then I have to remember which is which, etc. Also, I find the software fairly clumsy. On the flip side, they slowly seem to be improving it.<br /><br />I do like this better than my older TomToms, though. The larger screen, free"

1141972,2042968,"Got the unit and used it the following weekend.  Followed the assembly instruction and set up instructions.  Worked great on a 5 ft x 5 ft section of the carpet (berber).  Then the brushes stopped spinning. Strike 1. We continued to clean the carpet because it had to be done and the carpet was all wet.  So we kept going w/o the brushes spinning. Then I noticed that when we tipped back the handle there was a stream of water coming out where the hand held attachment is stored on the unit.  Strike 2... It still did a really good job at cleaning up all the stains.  Since the clean water tank was leaking the carpet was left soaking wet.  So I removed the water tank and went over the carpet again to suck up more of the water.  Most of the surface stains came out but really didn't get deep enough to remove the odors.  Strike 3... The room that we did was only an 11 ft x 11 ft.  So it would be nice that for the price that it would last longer than one room.  Over all I'm sure that it's a great carpet cleaner when working, but since the plastic piece that turns the brushes snapped off the brushes no longer turned so we couldn't get that deep carpet cleaning that we needed.  Also can't figure out why the thank is leaking.  Called Hoover, they have a local service center that we will bring it to free"

Simple eye makeup remover pads were fantastic! The pads are pretty large and I only had to use one side to be able to remove all of my eye makeup (I attached a picture). I know that these pads got all of the traces of eye makeup off because after I took a shower there was no black lines under my eyes.

I depend on my Dentek Floss Threaders.  I thread my floss through this great big floppy plastic device that works like a needle and go to work on my teeth every day.  Using the DFT enables a through gum massage.<br /><br />Don't we know how important flossing is?  If we take care of our gums and teeth, we are also helping to maintain our heart health. Social health can be improved by flossing too. It is embarrassing to go out into the world with meat, lettuce, or collards stuck between our teeth.  Brown or green between the teeth could destroy a sale or a job interview.  Food trapped inside bridges and braces can contribute to halitosis.  Also it's not nice to try to fool our dental hygienists.  They will know if we have not been using our floss threaders.  Furthermore, bridges and braces cost! Anxiety can result from the loss of teeth and from gum disease.  We must take care of our teeth to avoid having to make a second mortgage to pay the dental bills.  We must use our floss threaders.  These little gadgets are worth their weight in gold!<br /><br />Some other brands I've tried pulled apart at the critical moment.

The present DVD product also fails to include some of America's most classic and enduring images, namely, the Dust Bowl photographs of Dorthea Lange (May 26, 1895-Oct. 11, 1965).  Dorthea Lange's photographs have become some of the icons (well-accepted symbols) of the United States of America (though not quite in the same league as icons, such as the Empire State Building or Yosemite Valley).<br /><br />The movie could also have shown a graph depicting rainfall for each year, from circa 1900 to 1960.  But there was no such graph.  The film briefly alludes to the accomplishments of Mr.Hugh Bennett, but really should have spent a little time disclosing the bare details of Mr.Bennett's accomplishments.

1185119,547747,"got this item from another place on the internet before Amazon. I'm a DIY guy so this is all done by my own hands (super easy if you're the slightest bit handy). Install goes easy as expected and I'm up and running in less than 30 minutes between the wires, the wifi, and downloading the app. Everything is great for a few days and I'm really pleased with my purchase. Day 4 or 5 I notice that smell you get turning the heat on for the first time of the year. I knew something was wrong because the heat had already run plenty this year and I have a heat pump system which usually doesn't make this smell. I looked at the thermostat and sure enough it had decided to fire my Emergency/Auxillary resistive heating cools which were probably caked in dust to burn off seeing as they haven't been needed or used in years. I investigated and found that for some reason the thermostat was no longer turning the compressor on so the system wasn't generating any heat. I played around with the settings for a while but just couldn't get it working. Before calling Honeywell support I manually tested the wires myself and found the compressor to turn on just fine. I even put the old thermostat back on again to keep the house warm and it worked just fine (save your old stat if you still plan to buy this thing just in case).    Now here comes the worst support call I have ever encountered. I call Honeywell and get connected to a tech who seems to only be able to formulate sentences after 30 seconds of silence.

LA county is huge so yes, some areas don't get great signal but come on Magellan but those customer lack-of support people a clue.  I'd driven for an hour before I got to Oceanside in North San Diego County and traffic ground to a halt just like always.  I looked at the unit and found to my surprise there was a red outline to the traffic triangle - yay, success it must be getting some signal!  It did and showed me not the traffic jam I was in but two others on my route 18 and 32 miles away. The Oceanside back up was normal and heavy rain slowed it down more.  But 3 minutes later I was back up to 60MPH.    Out in Alpine (30 miles east of downtown San Diego) it's hill country in the high desert so when I got in the car for the drive back I didn't expect a signal; to my surprise the traffic icon had a green outline and when pushed indicated a strong traffic signal.  Yay...maybe I had a keeper?  What I like:  The unit has a great display - strong colors easy to read. Inputting destination data is easy - ZIP code entry is a good start not available on the comparable Brand X units which require you to input the state, then city, then street.  If you are a PC I suggest you update the software ASAP, if you are a MAC you are SOL - Brand X offers compatibility for both.   What I don't like:  It's hard to input data and requires use of a fingernail or stylist; I suppose that's good and cuts down on input error.  There is no \\""quick start\\"" guide in the box and no CD so Magellan has decided that their devices are so intuitive that it isn't necessary to include those - keeping the cost down.  Hey Magellan, it's really hard to figure the unit out if it won't power up so you can sit at your computer and read this stuff on your website.    No AC power cable.  With all the cool routing ability it would be nice to sit down and program in your address book, multiple trips with multiple locations rather than struggle with this in the car.   No address book interface.  No MAC compatibility.  Card slot for pictures is a complete waste of time.  If you are driving there is only one thing you should be doing, driving, not looking at pictures.  No ability to change the voice.  The worst customer service on the planet.

My conclusion is that this is a very good unit for the price as long as you don't pay retail.

It is not a cure-all but does have a noticeable effect that I think can play a part in helping.  I have both insomnia and a non-24 hour sleep shifting, irritated by allergies :(.  With this alarm clock, I notice that something in my brain is activated that isn't without it.  It isn't enough to magically make me function on 4 hours of sleep, but it is a nice way to way up when I have gotten enough sleep and I think can be useful in combination with other things in helping with severe sleep issues and might be more helpful for people with less severe sleep issues.<br /><br />I was hopeful that the sunset simulation would help me get to sleep, but it doesn't have any direct effect.  I still find it very pleasant and like it for that reason.  I would personally find it more useful it it had 90 and 120 minute settings and I could quietly read for a while before it forces me to put down the book.  I could at least read on full bright and set an alarm for when to start the sunset simulation; the alarms are easier to change time than most alarm clocks, but still is less convenient than it could be for me.  I suspect most folks will find the provided settings to be fine.<br /><br />I tried positioning the clock two ways: 2-3 feet above me just past the foot of my bed and just above my head and a little behind.  I just moved it to the second position a few days ago after two and a half weeks in the first position; so far it seems like both positions work similarly for everything.<br /><br />I like that it gives you a chance to change the alarm time when you set an alarm and that you can turn off the alarm sound or light per alarm if you want, making it possible to use in combination with wake up watches or cd alarm clocks or to help find the optimal combination for two people using it at different times.  I find the alarm sounds to be much nicer than most alarm clocksounds.<br /><br />I dislike that the touch sensitivity for the snooze feature is very low and I end up tapping it several times to work (although this could be seen as a feature, needing to wake up that much more to have it stop chirping for a few minutes).  The touch controls for the menu and time adjustment work perfectly, but you can't use them to snooze.  Also, the brightness buttons are right next to the lamp off button and I occasionally bump them when turning off the light (which affects the initial brightness used for the sleep countdown feature).  It doesn't really matter, it just happens to annoy me a little bit.<br /><br />The only major disadvantage is the price; with the colored light and leds I think they have a good design that will hopefully be rolled out more widely at a lower price.  I think it is much closer to my ideal alarm clock than any other that I've tried.<br /><br />I once purchased a similarly expensive Zen Alarm Clock, based on the excellent idea of a similar gradual awakening, only with sound instead of light (in theory, with really nice sound).  That alarm was so ridiculously low quality with obviously little or no testing"

The SC-81 is a recent launch by Pioneer (around August 2014) and includes the HDMI 2.0, the newest version of the HDMI standard which claims increased bandwidth, resolution and frame-rate capability, and supporting 4K resolution at 60 frames per second all with 7 HDMI inputs and 2 outputs.  That alone makes this a powerhouse AV receiver I could not even dream of 5 years ago. This should definitely serve the needs of the vast majority of users especially at with seven channels of Elite Class D3 amplification ( total of 560 Watts on 7 channels) rated at 120 watts x 7 channels (8 Ohms, 1kHz, 0.08% THD 2 Ch).<br /><br />Setup was a little tough given my lack of experience with this level of receiver. If you demand great sound from this receiver, you have to be willing to deal with manual calibration (Advanced Multi-Channel Acoustic Calibration system (MCACC)) as it generally will not sound its best using the \\""full auto\\"" calibration setup. For those who don't want to spend that kind of time, cancel the \\""full auto\\"" setup after plugging in the microphone and run the \\""auto\\"" setup. This will provide a more balanced sound.<br /><br />Aside from the typical AV receiver, the SC-81 integrated the Internet (spotify and others), Apple Airplay, Android, and it's also Windows 8 certified allowing access to your entire media library.

You can't give Logitech much flak for not perfecting a 7.1 surround sound headset when no other peripheral has done it, but the sound was acceptable (If you are an audiophile you will not be dissapointed with this headsets audio quality). I recommend turning down the default settings for the speakers within the headset to ten instead of eleven. The default setting causes the base to clip (This is just because its too damn loud). The software also comes with a graphic equalizer you can use to adjust the quality of your playback if you are a little more advanced with that kind of thing. I did have some qualms with the microphone quality though. It is really mediocre. Granted its a gaming headset and you just have to be audible for your teammates to understand you, for the price, they could have done a better job with it. If you are looking for a high quality mic with this headset, look elsewhere.<br /><br />The Macros are there and are easy to set up using the software you will either install online or using the disk that came with the product.

My previous Roomba (a 560 model that I named Oscar) is a very picky grouch. Oscar works acceptably on carpet, but has a hard time with hardwood and is useless on tile. In order to get him to clean solid surfaces, I would have to tape two 3 lb hand weights to the top. That is not an exaggeration. When I moved to a house that was mostly tile, I basically gave up using the Roomba and he has been sitting on the dock ever since. I originally bought the Roomba because I have a cat who both sheds and kicks her litter around vigorously.  I was sick of having cat hair and kitty litter granules all over the place and was upset that my 560 did not work well in this regard. Even when it would pick up hair, it would clog the dust bin entrance and need to be cleaned out every 3-5 minutes to continue working. It didn't help that I have long hair and shed almost as much as my cat. It also doesn't help that litter likes to find all the little crevices in the tile. It was a total fail.<br /><br />So, when iRobot came out with a model that supposedly worked well on solid surfaces AND was geared toward pet hair, I was a bit skeptical.

My thoughts below...    I took this camera with me on a tropical vacation with the intent to shoot underwater photos and videos, and it worked out great!  There is an option in the settings menu to color-correct for underwater use.  If you don't turn this on, your photos and videos will come out with a green tinge.  Remember to turn this on for underwater use!    There are 4 different options for video shooting:  1080p, 720 at 60 frames per second, 720 at 30 fps, and iPad compatible.  The 720 @ 60fps looks especially nice and crisp with the higher fps setting.  Use this setting for videos that you expect to have a lot of movement in.  The 1080p will look choppy when panning around too quickly or shooting video that has a lot of movement in it.  The 720 @ 30 fps and the iPad compatible settings are geared toward shooting video where there isn't a lot of quick movement.  Even though the 720@60 setting produced the best video, I found myself using the iPad compatible setting the most.  The file size for this setting was the smallest, and the video quality was still very good.  I was very impressed with the results.  I used a 16GB Sandisk memory card with this camera.  At the 720@60 setting, you are able to record up to 2hrs and 45 mins of total video footage and around 12000 photos.  Your mileage may vary.    The camera function leaves something to be desired.  Although it takes good-not-great photos (that's what your point-and-shoot camera is for), I recommend taking photos during the daytime and un-zoomed.  The photo quality during low-light conditions or at night is extremely poor and very grainy.  This is strictly a daytime or bright light camera.  Also, the photo quality degrades significantly if you use the zoom function even in bright daytime light.  I suggest not using the zoom at all and shooting during the day or with lots of light.  The nice thing about the ZX5 over the ZX3 is the macro focus function.  If you want to take photos of objects that are very close to the camera, select this function.

BWP is better known due to their clever viral marketing; this one deserves to be better known, as it is far superior. The story is fairly implausible, even for science fiction, involving time travel, weird physics (that admittedly doesn't make much sense) and people who live on the moon. On the other hand, I found it completely riveting, very spooky and evocative. The acting is generally pitch perfect (there are a few bad performances in a fairly big cast -I'm assuming some or most of the folks weren't professional actors), the characterization is strong, and the dramatic tension is high through the whole film. This guy can really tell a story, and he didn't need an enormous budget, Hollywood cast, fancy sets, lots of extraneous whooshing sounds or wacky CGI special effects to make it work.

1283559,1373094,"got this unit to have an extra place to charge our many iPhones and iPods and to use as an alarm clock.  Upon setting it up, however, I was very surprised at the richness of the sound it produced.  I am pretty picky about sound quality and I don't really like to play my iPod on anything other than my Bose Sound Dock.  Although I wouldn't say it is on the same par with a Bose system, I am very happy with the sound quality of this unit.  It's nice to be able to listen to music in another part of the house and to be satisfied with the sound.  It isn't tinny sounding and doesn't distort while playing at louder volumes.  The ability to charge both iPhones and iPods is a huge plus for us.  The FM radio is very nice, too.  We often get static when trying to listen to stations a little far away, but this unit brought them in loud and clear.  I was surprised.  The radio scans for clear stations and you can program several as favorites.  I read in other review"
1283627,3415455,"receiver unit which picks up the (non-directional) RF commands from the remote.  Doesn't particularly matter where I point the remote, the plasma is going to receive the commands every time.  I can't control the DirecTV box that is set to be controlled via RF with it, but I no longer have to 'train' guests to \\""point this way, then point that way.\\""  That, in of itself, is a win.<br /><br />From a setup and functionality standpoint, the 900 stands equal or superior to the ONE.  It took me less than 15 minutes to install the software and set up the remote to control all my IR equipment in the room (seven pieces).  When I went to use it, I discovered the PageUp/PageDown arrows weren't working in the DirecTV menus as they had with the ONE, so I called Logitech customer support and within a matter of minutes had a very helpful and friendly tech looking directly at my settings and asking me if I wanted him to make the change or if I'd like him to walk me through how to do it.  I chose the latter, and was also able to set up the '+' button as a direct means of access to my DVR recorded program list.  What's noteworthy about this isn't necessarily that it's comically easy (so much so I felt a little foolish having missed it) to customize the functionality of your buttons, but that it was quick and easy to get a person on the phone who was happy to help.  That's rare access and service these days, and Logitech puts enough of an emphasis on it that it's as relevant to my experience and the resulting review"

1292376,465621,"sent the product in use, but one or two of the photos show the lig, or the lig and cap, on the mouthpiece.  At around $28, read this too fast and you might think you are buying a Rico mouthpiece as well.  After all, it is priced around the same as some Rico mouthpieces.  This is not a complaint, just a note for anyone who orders mainly by looking at the photos.<br /><br />The included cap is decent. It fit snugly, but that may vary depending on your mouthpiece.  It is plastic but rubberized so you are less prone to drop it.  Some of us have been there: plastic cap slips, you reach to catch it or pick it up, horn hits a stand, hello dent in bell.<br /><br />Unless you are a professional who wants/needs superior equipment, this lig will work very nicely for the student and occasional player.  Price-wise, you may want to consider the Rico silver plated lig and cap set to save a few dollars, or the basic Rico four point ligature which can be about half the price.  If you are in need of a basic mouthpiece, another option, if this is for a student, is to spend $5 more and get a starter kit which has the lig and cap but also a mouthpiece and cork grease.  I think it even includes a couple of 2 ½ reeds.  They are not the best quality, but it is a decent starter kit.<br /><br />The caveat with all of these is, this lig should fit most standard size mouthpieces.  It fit my Rico mouthpiece fine but I have seen other review"

1325817,2829888,"get production out of such slight material.    For reasons of masochism I have returned to the movie two more times over the last nine years.  And it remains a colossal dud.  If you accept the painful inert pacing and the tiny storyline then it's not too painful, but it's still far from being even borderline okay.    I decided to try something a little bit out of the box in an attempt to make it watchable for my fourth viewing.  I decided to watch the whole thing at x2 fast forward.  95% of the dialogue remained intelligible, and the 5% I didn't pick up I either didn't care about or I could work out the gist from the dialogue surrounding it.  This way the awful draggy pace will be picked up and the running time halved to a more realistic 75 minutes.    And the film was bearable.  The crap story and banal dialogue etc didn't suddenly burst into life, but at least things moved at a reasonable non-patience trying speed.  For the majority of the film I was thinking it was a tepid two star movie.      And then the last post-orgy stretch turned up.  If anything, the film SLOWED DOWN even further as Tom Cruise revisited the previous scenes.  Seriously, what film slows down as it reaches its climax?  A normal film is always gathering speed so that by the end it's racing towards the end.  Kubrick and the Coen Brothers are about the only filmmakers I can think of who start slow and stay at that exact same pace from start to finish.  It's just wrong.      The Coen Brothers movies used to drive me up the wall with the slow pace of all of their films until I learned to expect, and accept it.  Fargo for example was such a horrible viewing experience first time I saw it as it took forever to get anywhere.  Now whenever I put one of their films on I say to myself to expect that it will be slow from start to finish.  If you expect it to take forever to get anywhere then it can't frustrate you as it's exactly what you expected (it's not the traffic jam that's making you angry, it's your expectations of getting to your destination quickly that is causing you to lose your temper).    I can sit happily through almost any Coen Brothers film now, as long as it's actually a good film like Fargo, but Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut is way beyond the pale.  Even at x2 speed the film drags at its climax.  So the two star review"

1329593,2864445,"got the unit for $199.  The vacuum was already assembled, so I cannot speak to how easy it was to set up.  I've only had the vacuum a few hours, so I can't testify to the durability or reliability of the machine.  So far, the PROs are:  -That fabulous magnetic hose.  It took me a few minutes to realize that the wand actually telescopes out, which can be a bit of a hassle if you forget to retract it before replacing the hose (like I did 3 times... hope I've learned by now!).  It's not as easy as the \\""quick draw\\"" hose on my old panasonic that I had for 8 years, but it's the easiest to deal with of the vacuums I test-drove at the store.  -The bottom-empty dust canister.  I hate--and I mean HATE--bagless vacuums.  I was NOT going to buy one.  But the canister is easy to remove and empty, which takes away two ofthe things I hate about bagless.  -This vacuum is QUIET, for a vacuum cleaner.  I couldn't believe it.  I just got rid of a little \\""dorm-sized\\"" bissell bagless I bought from Wally-world for $30.  It was almost deafening.  The LG is fairly quiet, even on my concrete floors.  Amazing!  -It really picks up some stuff.  With just one pass, my carpet looked better than it did with 4 or 5 passes of my little bissell.  -The dust canister is very large.  I haven't emptied the canister yet to see how well the Kompressor bit helps out, but part of why I bought the LG was the compression of the dirt, along with the larger canister, for less emptying.  With my little bissell, I could hardly vacuum half a room without having to empty the canister.  -That little rotary brush attachment is fabulous!  I've never had one of those before.  I was able to vacuum between the pedestal legs of an end table, and some other tight spots the upright couldn't fit into.  -I've got an English Shepherd (collie-type dog) who sheds puffs of fur, just by looking at the carpet.  The LG did a great job of removing the puffs, and even got the thin \\""film\\"" of fur that never really got picked up by my bissell.  -The retractable cord is nifty.  I don't really have any issues with winding a cord, so it wasn't a huge selling point for ME, by my husband thinks the retractable cord is just too cool.  He says he might even vacuum now.  :)  And now for the CONS:     -Heavy!  So many of the review"

1337080,365765,"Receiver unit: (Not really a receiver but I will call it that)<br />  -) Considering other competing brands at this price range have multiple inputs and outputs, it could not have hurt to place at minimum 1 HDMI in and out to justify this unit. To be honest this unit is really unnecessary. Take the HTB-20 as a prime example, does all of what the HTB-350 does (excluding the wireless Sub and Bluetooth) and performs equally as well without the need of this box.<br />  -) The two optical inputs work wonderfully well. But yes you do need to buy these cables. (and no they should not come with them, think printer cables) I got mine from Amazon.com as well for less than $12.<br />  -) Has no letters or numbers to read when you are changing anything, but does not really need them. You have blinking LEDs when you push any buttons on the remote.<br />  -) Has redundant buttons on the box for volume rocker an well as input changer. Only thing on on the box is the Bluetooth pairing button.<br /><br />6) Remote: (This was an after thought)<br />  -) Has a couple of other buttons which the box unit did not have: Bluetooth pairing, Sub level +/- button, and one for voice (forgot the exact name) +/- button. This does noticeably help to hear the voice of the title you are watching. Leaving it mid way usually work best for both overall clarity and fidelity of voice/sound fx/music.<br /><br />Overall experience with this unit has been great. Iam very happy I bought this unit although I would highly recommend the cheaper HTB-20 to anyone as that has the better bang per buck value. (4.5/5 rating)<br /><br />Hope you find this review"
1338610,3313673,"get some product in stock. A few things to note for those new to Senseo, their majority holdings from Philips were recently sold to Sara Lee I believe, and this caused a massive disruption in production and availability for the US, and thus Senseo brand coffee had been unavailable for several months. They have also made the decision to go to online-only shipping of their coffee, meaning you will not find Senseo coffee in stores anymore. The in-store alternative is the Melitta brand pods, which fit the Senseo maker, and should be sold in places such as WalMart. Personally, since Senseo has also increased their costs of their coffee (while also jerking their customers such as myself around for months), I won't really recommend the Senseo brand anymore. Decent coffee depending on your tastes, so you will have to decide what's worthwhile to you.<br /><br />The review"

The stations connect and buffer pretty quick so, waiting for a station to queue up is not frustrating. Thank god Grace got that right. Any delay over three seconds would be frustrating - much like waiting for a download on a 24k modem but, that is not the case. All the stations I breezed through loaded in under three seconds unless it was offline or not broadcasting at that time. When that would happen, the display would just say that station is offline.<br /><br />With all that excitement what is there not to like? Well, navigation itself can a be a tad cumbersome and time consuming due to the sheer amount of content available at the listener's fingertips. Younger folks may not have the patience to navigate though the various menus and choices. However, those of us who appreciate the ritualistic approach to audio such as taking an LP out of it's protective sleeve or placing a CD on the tray and shutting the door will appreciate this. There is so much content to explore that patience is a requirement.<br /><br />I immediately tuned in two of my favorite stations (Z-rock and HardRockin' 80's) and was able to set those as presets on the remote so now, I can access them easily. I also took time explore by stations by country. Radio Tunisia anyone? How about Hong Kong Radio or a 90's and 80's mix from Croatia? If you can think it, it is likely out there. I hit some morning show in Baltimore that captured my interest for a spell and ended up in Texas Exile.<br /><br />The unit will also accept a usb device such as a thumb or hard drive or an SD card to play content off of.

There's the normal warranty/product info pamphlet, instructions, and in this case, a really neat letter welcoming you to the Presonus family.<br /><br />As far as box openings go, I was really surprised at how far Presonus went to prepare and ship the product, and then to top it off, they personalize it a little more with the letter. It's a nice touch.<br /><br />Once the speakers are removed from their protection and plastic covers, it's a pretty straight forward install. Connect a few wires to the coordinating slots on the back of the left speaker, plug in the power supply, and Bob's your uncle.<br /><br />For me, I decided to test out the speakers with my turntable. I plugged my RCA cables into my preamp, then into the back of the speakers, laid down my original Star Wars Episode IV OST, hit the power button, and dropped the needle.<br /><br />But low and behold, as soon as I turned them on, that dreaded amplifier hiss engulfed my ears and throttled me into a state of pure dispair. It's utterly pervasive and weaves it's way into whatever other sounds are coming out of the speakers.<br /><br />Iwas obviously not ok with this, which led me to Presonus's half terrible, half amazing customer service. It's a mixed bag really, and here's why:<br /><br />If you call into Presonus's hotline, and then go through the numerous menus you have to go through to get to the correct section, you  be put on hold. And then you'll wait.<br /><br />And wait.<br /><br />And wait.<br /><br />I waited for about an hour, and then the call dropped.<br /><br />I did this twice.<br /><br />Finally, I called the number again, and mashed the 0 button on my phone until someone answered.<br /><br />And therein lies the trick: just mash 0 on your phone and a real person will answer and get your problem sorted. I went through with the Presonus worker on the phone and explained my problem. He had me fill out an online ticket and put my problem into the description, and then wait.<br /><br />Less than ten minutes later, I had someone helping me. However, we couldn't figure out the problem, and it was decided that my speakers were defective. I went to Amazon and started the refund process, sadly printing out my slip because I had wanted these speakers to work so badly.<br /><br />Then a thought hit me.<br /><br />Maybe it wasn't the speakers. Maybe it was the source audio.<br /><br />So I tried the Bluetooth on my phone.<br /><br />No dice. The hiss was still there, as prominent and annoying as ever.<br /><br />Distraught, I started to unplug cables from the back, starting with the RCA cables that went into my preamp.<br /><br />Suddenly, the hiss was gone.<br /><br />The music from my phone that was still playing over Bluetooth was as crisp and as clear and as beautiful as I had imagined it would sound, only this time, the amp hiss was absent.<br /><br />I racked my brain as to why the preamp could possibly be making the hiss, and I realized it was because it wasn't grounded. Most cables nowadays have a ground wire built in, but my preamp didn't. So now, I'll have to manually ground it, which isn't a big deal in order for me to get perfect sounding music and films.<br /><br />Moral of the story: make sure that your source audio (and anything that it has to go through in order to reach the speakers) is grounded! Otherwise you'll get a feedback"

However, despite the simplicity and the feel that this album may at times be the slightest bit simplistic, this album definitely deserved release.  If nothing else, it is a soothing, if not spiritually-rousing, release that affirms the music that Jackson listened and grew up with in his childhood.<br /><br />There are no particular standouts in this album because for the most part the tracks are on an equal playing field. What is slightly disappointing from Jackson's perspective is that you would've hoped that a drum set, hand claps, or even more vocal melismas/nuances would've been added to the performance.  While you understand Jackson's motives, you just can't help but wonder why didn't Jackson put the slightest bit more thought into PRECIOUS MEMORIES. With nuances and slightly more overall creativity, the album would've been more exciting than it is. Also disappointing is that Jackson doesn't record track \\""Precious Memories\\"" on the album of the same title.<br /><br />Overall, positives of PRECIOUS MEMORIES include song selection, which makes this album actually sound better than it should, length, very tight and short, and the simplicity, even if it is too simplistic.

1421376,1262962,"given this product 5 stars because I feel it is a very good product and it would be possible for many people to achieve success with it if they are willing to face its limitations (moving the antenna to possibly very visible locations and having the cable visible).  However, this is claimed to be a 50 mile antenna.  That will vary greatly depending on terrain, buildings, tuner sensitivity and atmospheric conditions.  I think the 50 miles is simply a theoretical maximum that few people will actually achieve.<br /><br />The purpose of these antennas, obviously, is to allow reception of local programming.  We depend on the local channels for news, weather and favorite TV shows.  In addition to the antennas for over the air programming, we have 2 Roku boxes and subscriptions to Netflix and Hulu Plus.  The price of the antennas is very good considering that we were spending over $1,400/year for cable TV!<br /><br />Update: One thing we missed when we dumped the cable boxes was the built in information concerning what programming was available on what channels at a given time.

I bought one)<br /><br />I've been using Seagate for my USB drives more lately and the latest Backup Plus is, like its predecessors, a pretty good product.  I've read that some of the first models had a tendency to get hot, but so far mine's been powered on and lying flat on my desktop for a week, being used quite a lot, and it's only moderately warm.  There was also an annoying problem with earlier models that they would randomly disconnect to save power--and I'm pleased to say that I'm not seeing this happen today.<br /><br />If you're new to USB hard drives, or just Seagate's USB drives, setup is really easy on a Windows system:  plug in the drive with the AC adapter, then plug the drive's USB cable into your PC and within seconds it should be ready to go.  There is a Seagate utility already pre-loaded on the drive for you to install on a PC or Mac that will let you back up one or more devices, and this is really the only drawback.  The software works, mostly, but it may take quite a while--days--to do a first-time system backup.  At the 5-day mark, leaving my PC up for 3 of those nights, I'm now at 85% backing up 1.5TB.  The app will back up mobile devices, with the caveat that said device needs to be hooked up to a computer during this time so that the software can see it.<br /><br />When you install the software, it's very adamant that you have to register your drive with Seagate before it will continue.  Slightly annoying, but perhaps this at least guarantees that you'll be able to get warranty support.  But then it takes you to a page that wants to sell you a different backup utility for $99.  This can be really confusing:  the only software you get with the drive is called &#34;Seagate Dashboard&#34;--but that actually is your backup utility.

Same as the pro (small size), but this was such a big con for me (family of 5), that it made the unit almost worthless.  YMMV.  It's so small that I couldn't even fit smallish frozen pizzas in there.  And you can forget about some of the what I would consider normal sized frozen pizza brands (diGiorno, Tombstone, California Pizza Kitchen).  Not gonna fit.  I was also used to cooking even large frozen dishes like lasagnas or pasta dishes in the Breville, and you can forget about that with this one.  Again, this can be a pro or con for you, depending on your usage.  But if you like to use your toaster as an oven like we do, I would look elsewhere.<br /><br />2.  Uneven cooking.  This one surprised me.  There is a definite heat bias towards the back of the unit (and I think they mention this in the manual even),so that in some cases, you will need to rotate things for even cooking.  Big pain, for me, and that right there is a deal breaker.  (you don't HAVE to rotate things, of course, but you will have quite varying degrees of doneness from food in the front vs food in back)<br /><br />3. Learning curve.  Didn't expect this either, but it also ties into the whole \\""this thing is cool, but kind of a pain!\\"" mentality I have regarding the toaster.  You can forget about looking at the back of the box of frozen food for indications on what temp and time settings to use.  Due to the faster cooking, and I think the way it cooks, it's almost like there are no directions for you to go by, except your own trial and error.  I have burned many a frozen thing, (while inside wasstill cold), and I have had cases where I had to \\""reheat\\"" something multiple times because what I thought was done, needed more cooking.  You will probably get used to the non-standard calibration over time, but do you really want to have to come up with custom settings, and maybe more importantly LEARN the appropriate setting for every new thing you cook?  Blegh.<br /><br />4. My biggest hope for this was spectacular toast.  If it could have done that, I might have considered keeping it just for that reason, and going back to using the regular oven for larger items.  Nooooo!  Due to the lack of an adjustable height rack (!?!), Every time I toasted something, the bottom (which you can't see, obviously), gets many times darker than the top, and it should be the opposite, IMO, if only for the fact that you can visually inspect to see if your toast is burning or not.  This killed me, and is unfortunate, especially if you are a pre-butterer like I am (something the manual states you SHOULD NOT do since it might catch fire!)  Rebel, and noted cynic that I am, I DID pre-butter, and had no problems (and IMO you want the buttered side to be the more toasted, not the opposite, and I did not want to toast buttered side down, so you see my dilemma!)  :D<br /><br />I could go on, and I fully realize that a lot of people have and do disagree with the above points (look at the review"

1449961,158514,"receive your product. From there, as stated before, you will receive the product based on the appointment you scheduled. I would've technically received my tv today; however, being impatient, I was able to call the company and reschedule the appointment for the day after they received the tv, last Friday.<br /><br />So, I'm waiting all morning, very excitedly, and I receive the phone call to confirm that I would be home to accept the delivery. The delivery guy comes, places the tv in my kitchen, I sign to confirm receipt, and the guy leaves. I knew I took a gamble by not having him open the box, inspect the tv, and turn it on, but I am rather impatient when it comes to these things, and plus... the tv is brand new. Box was sealed with no real damage, except for a small tear that wouldn't reach the tv inside. I highly suggest that you inform them to pull it out and expect it, as per their policy. If there's a discrepancy, then you tell the guy to pack it back up and return it to Amazon.<br /><br />Setup was a breeze: place the tv (two-man job, it is big and rather heavy) on a sturdy surface on its back (I guess you can place it on its front, too), screw in the base and back piece, set it on your stand, plug in your HDMI cables, power it up. No brain work here.<br /><br />Once the tv powers on (and you recover from how big the screen is), the setup wizard comes on. It isa total breeze and tells you exactly what to do. If I remember correctly, someone was complaining about connecting this to their wi-fi. That person probably has no idea what wi-fi is. All you have to do is choose your network (that you would've named yourself, naturally), enter your password, and the tv will connect to your wi-fi network. That's it.<br /><br />Here's (in my opinion) probably the best feature of the tv (that I hope I can make you see how you're going to save money if you're debating buying the upcoming Xbox One): it asks you about which cable tv company and box you're using, and once you choose it (and depending which service/box you have), your tv will now control your service box almost completely! The interface will straight-up blow your mind. It will do things your cable box simply can not do. I'll give you an example of such features when I get to the Magic Remote. The reason I brought up the Xbox One is that one of its (huge) selling points is that you will be able to plug your cable box directly into the Xbox via hdmi, and then plug the Xbox into your tv via hmdi and the Xbox will take over your cable box with its own interface. This tv already does that, so well that I can't see how I will take advantage of that feature when I receive my Xbox One. If you're not a gamer and was debating getting an Xbox One for that feature alone, congrats, you just saved $500!<br /><br />Here's other ways to save money: being that this is a Smart TV, it is loaded with many awesome apps. Most Blu-Ray players and AppleTVs and Rokus all come with these apps, but if you're debating buying any of these items to be able to use apps (Netflix, YouTube, etc.) on this tv, you won't need them. Heck, if you're the kind of person that rents movies or orders movies on demand instead of buying actual Blu-Ray movies or dvds, then you won't need to buy an actual player.<br /><br />Since we're talking about apps, let me tell you that they work very well on this tv. There will be the occasional hiccups: while listening to music on Pandora, after one song played, the app pretty much froze, back button or return to tv button wouldn't work, so I had to turn the tv off and turn it back on. Not too much of a deal because the tv loads pretty fast (it's not a computer). The same thing happened while I was trying to set up a Redbox account. Sometimes, an app will simply quit working and instantly return you to whatever you were watching on tv, but that really isn't a bad thing at all. I'm sure there will be plenty of updates to fix these very minor problems.<br /><br />When they work, the apps are amazing. YouTube has never looked better, and it is a lot of fun to watch your favorite YouTube flicks on a 60\\"" screen. I played one game where you drop cheese and rats get into a trance and follow the odor of the cheese to their demise, which is a really silly and worthless game to play, but I can see how it could keep a child entertained. The game worked flawlessly. There are tons of apps that come with the tv, most of them I doubt I would ever use, but it's nice to know they're there.<br /><br />Browsing the internet has never looked so good! And it is the actual internet, not some watered-down mobile version of it like you would see on your phone. Flash works here just fine. I have tried going onto certain websites that allow you to watch movies that haven't hit stores yet *cough cough still in theaters cough*, and it seems that certain websites are blocked or something. When the movie is going to load, the browser simply closes and you're back to watching tv. I was, however, successful after jumping through hoops (if you've seen these websites, you know what I'm talking about) and was able to watch some movie about buff dudes driving furiously fast cars.<br /><br />The Magic Remote is truly a sight to behold. Yes, it has a built-in mic that works surprisingly well. What makes it so cool is that the whole interface that works with your cable box ties directly into other apps and the internet. For example, you can say \\""Look up Banshee\\"". Give it a second, your command will pop up on the screen along with a cute red-head virtual chick, she'll act like she's thinking, and then the entire screen will change. It'll give you options to choose from either clicking a channel that is showing/will show Banshee, look up trailers of Banshee on YouTube, or go to Bing's search of Banshee. And it works very fast and flawlessly. This is the reason why I will probably not tie my Xbox One into the cable box because I highly doubt it will work this well, who knows.<br /><br />The Magic Remote will also take over your cable box remote. You can now scroll channels up or down, pull up your cable box guide, or you can use the tv's interface, which is very cool, but I really don't find myself using too much. One (kind of stupid, really) way to find channels is that you can hold down the scroll button, and \\""write\\"" the numbers of the channel on the screen (it works like a Wii-mote), and the tv will input the channel number you've \\""written\\"" and go to that channel. Or, you can hold the scroll button and wave to the right, and the tv will switch you to the last channel you were watching (useful).<br /><br />The tv itself looks absolutely amazing. I have never gone with a plasma before because, as a gamer, I've always followed the rule that LCD/LED is for gaming, plasma is for movies. That's all done with now. I'm playing Modern Warfare 3 and this thing does not tear up, lag, ghost... none of that. It looks absolutely perfect. TV and movies look amazing as well. The colors are absolutely phenomenal. Blacks are black, something my LED just can't seem to get right. Obviously, I had to mess with the settings to get them to my liking, but with their set-up wizard for color it was quite a breeze. The end result is a picture that I am in love with, that feels much warmer and more realistic that I have yet to see an LED replicate.<br /><br />Minor gripe, like everyone else, is that it doesn't come with 3D glasses, and worse yet, are not yet available. I think LG dropped the ball on this. I understand they may have left them out to keep the price down, but c'mon, at least make them available to purchase.<br /><br />I will keep updating this review"

The remainder of the strands remained solid red.<br /><br />There seem to be a large proportion of styles to pistils.  The pistil is the valuable part of the saffron crocus, and the style is rather worthless although still red.  One way to cut the cost of saffron is to add more styles.<br /><br />However, I cannot legitimately say that the styles are not just broken off of whole pistils and I cannot say yet what I would see in other products, so I am going to wait to add that aspect to this review"

If you squeeze and twist it gently, there's a tiny bit of creaking. The styling is quite good, though. It also seems sturdy enough for its intended purpose as a HTPC keyboard. The keyboard is actually pretty good, though it's not high end. Trackpad is ok, and large enough, though there are far nicer trackpads out there. I do get fatigued using the trackpad after a long time, like if I decide to play a PC game with it, but that's really not what this is for. Keyboard and trackpad are plenty good for a HTPC, in which case, you only adjust it occasionally -- and are far, far better than on other low cost HTPC keyboards I've used. Again, the software works well and once you get used to the location of the settings window, it's easy enough to adjust. I really wish they'd let us re-map the &#34;home&#34; button, though.

Great actors, a great script, and resourceful direction can apparently create a terrific film with very little else. There is little I can say about Patricia Clarkson's performance except that she is brilliant as always. April's mother, Joy, is hypercritical, blunt, but a font of emotional strength, and no one could play this memorable character better. Oliver Platt departs from the quirky characters for which he is famous to play Jim, Joy's even-tempered tolerant husband. The supporting cast is large and perfect without exception: Alison Pill, who plays April's teenaged sister Beth, is destined to be a great character actress. Derek Luke, of &#34;Antwone Fisher&#34; fame, this time plays a man who is confident and comfortable with himself. All of April's neighbors are portrayed vividly, but especially memorable are Isiah Whitlock, Jr. and Lillias White as Eugene & Evette and Sean Hayes as nutty neighbor Wayne.<br /><br />&#34;Pieces of April&#34; is an engaging, ultimately optimistic, family drama that is somehow both idiosyncratic and universally true.

I honestly thought that this was like a deep conditioning treatment, I didn't realize that it was a chemical straightener!<br /><br />Within seconds after putting the product into my hair, I noticed my hair shriveling up and becoming 'gummy' so I rinsed it out right away.  I put the second treatment on, hoping that it would make my hair go back to at least normal, but it didn't.  As I towel dried my hair I realized that it was coming out by the handfuls  Every new glob of gummy hair made me feel like I was going to get sick.  It was horrifying.  I was up all night crying, I finally got the courage to run to Meijer at around 5AM, with my hood pulled up over my hair the entire time.... and got some 'Hair Mayo' in hopes that it would correct the issue, but it didn't.  I left it in for hours and couldn't sleep.<br /><br />After rinsing out the Mayo, I sat in my shower and cried and prayed that the nightmare would go away.  I finally fell asleep.  I'm a college student and I had a huge paper worth 20% of my grade due today and was hoping to work on that last night instead of crying and praying and wanting to die!<br /><br />When I woke up, my hair still felt like spaghetti.  The strands were completely ruined and thin and breaking off at the root.  I tried to blow dry it but it wouldn't dry, it just felt like cotton candy!  I scoured the internet for answers and discovered that this product has ruined the hair of many others as well!  It makes me infuriated that it's even on the shelves!  I went to the salon and the hairdresser was horrified.  She tried treatment after treatment and nothing helped.  The look on her face told me it was bad.  I told her I had been trying to grow out my hair and my layers and she just kept apologizing for what had happened!  2 hours and $60 worth of treatments, she ended up chopping about 3 inches of hair off the ends of all of my layers, and now it basically looks like I have a mullet.  The layers are choppy and terrible looking because she was afraid that if she thinned or texturized it, it would just cause the ends to keep shriveling and look even shorter.<br /><br />It is going to take years to repair what only minutes of having this product on my hair did.  I will never buy another Suave product again.

1522200,1988550,"got this product and I plug in my speakers to it (speakers I bought off of Amazon), and I try to pair this adapter with my Ipod Touch (5th Generation) Bluetooth, but no matter how many times I tried, I can't get a Bluetooth connection.  I really think I shouldn't have to mess with this product for a period of a year to get it to work.  Maybe it would work one day, after many trial and error, but so far I can't get it to work.  I really thought Logitech made solid products, but this one is so egregiously bad.  If it isn't compatible with Ipod Touch, it should say so in the product description.  I really don't like this product.    ******************************************************************************************    I originally gave this product a 1 star because it refused to work with my ipod touch no matter how much I tried (like a thousand times).  Now I'm giving it 4 stars.  I could give it 5 stars though, just the frustration that I had when getting it to work and low ease of use makes me notch it down a star.  This product does work with the ipod touch.  What I had to do was when the ipod touch refused to connect to the Bluetooth (Bluetooth device is on network but refuses to make a connection, even if tried a million times, with pairing, and button holding.), you have to tell the ipod touch to \\""Forget device\\"" -- that is forget the Bluetooth device, at which point the message \\""Not Paired\\"" would appear.  Upon the message \\""Not paired\\"", you have to pair it again.  If it doesn't work, you have to repeat the process.  For example, if you put your ipod touch in airplane mode, and you have to then put the ipod touch back into Bluetooth mode, you have to pair it again.  So you would have to \\""forget device\\"" again, and then get the \\""not paired\\"" message, then attempt to pair it again.  I think it's not very good ease of use to have to unpair then pair.  (That is, \\""forget the device\\"", then re-pair).  The fact that I had to figure this out on my own (the instruction manual does not tell me this), and that I have to un-pair and re-pair again means it's not very ameliorating to use easily.  That is why I would give it 4 stars.    ******************************************************************************************    update:  I like the sound, but there is one problem I wish could be addressed.  I wish this product would improve on this one point.  When connecting multiple devices (like your pc and ipod touch to this same Bluetooth adapter), I wish they would connect automatically without me going through 3-5 minutes of the pairing process.  Basically, the adapter doesn't like multiple devices connecting to it.  It would tend to bug out; that is, if a different device tried to connect to it, the adapter would ask that device to go through a quality control pairing process (and this happens every time you switch to a different device).  On the other hand, if you stick with only one device, you never have to pair it again 95% of the time.  But if you switch between computer and ipod touch, the unpair and pairing process has to be repeated.  It's tedious, I wish there was a automatic process that makes this event convenient and easy.  But sadly this is not the case.  I know it seems like I've complained a lot about this product, but I quite like Logitech products and have taken a fancy to them.  I think the sound quality is good (albeit I haven't compared it to different Bluetooth receivers, to me the sound quality is, to be sure, is more than satisfying).  In fact, I'm ordering a second pair of Logitech Bluetooth adapter, so even though I sound a little negative in this review"

1525346,2652332,"got this item today and I will update this in a few weeks when I have been able to play with it a little more. Here are the pros and cons so far:<br /><br />Pros:<br />Great screen size<br />Light and very portable<br />Keyboard size is nice since I have chunky fingers<br />Trackpad is responsive<br />Colors are pretty nice (i.e. colors are not washed out, blacks are black)<br />Full Windows 8<br />Just like a netbook/notebook<br />Love the tablet alone, too<br /><br />Cons:<br />faint light bleed on the right side (not enough to return it, though)<br />I keep hitting the &#34;full screen&#34; mode accidentally (just takes a simple swipe up on the track pad)<br />Learning curve for Windows 8 touch<br />The apps I am used to playing on iPad/Android are not in the Windows store<br /><br />So far, I am loving this little item. It is very smart, cute, and compact. I will say that the best way to make sure that your computer runs the way you want it to is to update it asap. As is normal with laptop purchases, I had 73 updates that needed to be installed right out of the box, It ran fine without the updates, but now the performance is stellar with them.<br />I was concerned about the &#34;sluggishness&#34; of the tablet/laptop because of the Atom processor. I am really not used to the Atom processor because my other laptops either do not have Intel at all or they have the higher i5 or i7 cores. So I was wary. So far, it seems to be able to run everything that I need it to very efficiently. I have even played some RPG games from the Windows store and it seems to be just fine. I also ran a few apps at once and it had no problem. I am sure if I tried to play WOW and have apps in the background, I would have some issues. But I just have to remember that  1. I don't actually play WOW and 2. This is not rated as a *gaming* laptop.<br />The Envy X2 plays Netflix, Youtube, and Amazon movies very well. It is not as clear as the screen on my HP Pavillion DV7 Blu-Ray laptop, but it is rivals the quality of my iPad 2 screen. I am satisfied with it. I also read that some people had issues with the resolution not being that great when using the tablet on its own (i.e. words being blurry, etc), but I have not seen anything to worry about with that. The words look fine to me. I read a LOT, too. I also have the Nook Color, Nook Simple touch, Nexus 10, Asus EEE TRansformer that I read on and I can truthfully say that I do not see that the experience on the Envy is any different than any of those- other than the fact that the Envy is larger.<br />Now, I LOVE that this laptop is full Windows 8. I was going to get the Surface RT until I realized that the RT stands for 'Not really worth the money'. Not really, but you get what I am saying. Windows 8 RT is a scaled down version of Windows that only runs apps from the severely lacking Windows store. Don't get me wrong. They are getting more apps every day. But I do not want to wait for months to get a game that I was playing yesterday on my android, iPad and Windows desktop. I actually was thisclose to buying the Surface just from the commercials because I was tired of the licensing games with Apple. And I was not sure what the RT really stood for. But once I realized it, I started researching! I went to the MIcrosoft website and they have several they suggest. This was the one that was the sleekest, had good review"

1528735,696510,"got this unit, I was Captain Ignorant on this stuff. I'm by no means an expert now, but there's some great info out there on the internet from folks that are that helped me understand how this works and how to install it safely. For example, from what I've read online, the 10kA SCCR rating means that this unit will probably sacrifice itself after one really large surge. Again, I'm no expert, but I think it's worth it for you to learn about the ratings involved (if you don't know that stuff already) to figure out if a higher-rated protector would be a better long-term investment after you consider the cost of the hardware and installation. Installation can range from you spending about an hour if you know what you're doing all the way up to paying for a professional electrician if you don't.<br /><br />Ratings aside, this is a nicely designed unit with some well-thought out touches. The front frame is removable to give you options on how to install it. Also, and I find this to be one of those unnecessary but \\""that's awesome!\\"" touches...the wire ends are already stripped for you about 3/4\\"", and they've left the insulation on the ends to protect the wires until you're ready to install. That is so handy and saves the need to dig out the wire strippers (or a knife if you're particularly handy). The wires are also already potted and sealed where they enter the white housing, which you want because one installation option has this protector mounted outside the main panel and subjected to the elements.<br /><br />I wouldn't rely on this to protect all of your gear, as it's still a good idea to have local protectors (e.g. power strips with protection), but it is some added security - and it's probably the only protection that you'll have on your major appliances. As for the warranty...I'm sure not going to count on it. That remark has nothing to do with Leviton, but it's just my mentality after reading remarks about numerous surge protector companies. There are so many possible loopholes that I never expect a company to pay up - for example, proving that you had it installed correctly.<br /><br />One review"

Still no link lights.<br />So I let the unit cool off for a couple of hours and tried it again.  This time it worked.  But about an hour later, it went down again.  The unit had good ventilation the whole time, just sitting on top of a desk with nothing else around it.

Print quality is good:  We printed a couple of photos using the printer and the color is good for the most part.  We found lighter colors (tan, cream, beige, light pink) to be somewhat off.  Don't use this copier to make up for professional printers if you need photos printed as gifts that incorporate these light colors.  Printing black and white documents in draft mode does not really sacrifice quality.  We were impressed that documents printed in draft mode were relatively crisp in appearance.  I feel completely comfortable printing professional documents (resumes, reports) with the draft mode.<br /><br />3. Great looking:  As noted, this is a sleek black printer that fits into the design of the home office.<br /><br />4. Scanning feature is so convenient:  A person can eliminate a lot of paper in the office by utilizing the printer's scanner.  I regularly scan resumes, recipes, and receipts and then .pdf these documents for easy sharing with others and my own reference.<br /><br />Some gripes:<br /><br />1.Will need cleaned frequently: The gloss and color of this piece of equipment means that finger prints and dust are easily seen.<br /><br />2.Paper tray is a bit small: The paper tray should have been a little larger in its capacity.  Admittedly, the capacity (which is a little less than 100 pages) is probably not atypical for a printer within this price range and for this printer's intended use and should be more than adequate for casual use and the home office.<br /><br />3.Cartridges: One of the largest gripes people have about printers typically relate to the cartridges.  A total of four small color cartridges, and one large black, feed the printer.  Canon sells the four smaller cartridges in packs and, at time of this writing, can be found for forty-five to fifty dollars. To buy, go here: [[ASIN:B003QR87I6 Canon PGI-225 BK/ CLI-226 C,M,Y 4 Pack Value Pack (4530B008) in Retail Packaging]].  The smaller cartridges purchased alone are about thirteen dollars, which can be purchased here: [[ASIN:B003QR48TI Canon CLI-226 Magenta Ink Tank (4548B001)]], [[ASIN:B003QR886M Canon CLI-226 Cyan Ink Tank (4547B001)]], and [[ASIN:B003QR28RC Canon CLI-226 Yellow Ink Tank (4549B001)]].<br /><br />4.Printing speed: While print quality is good, the speed is not great.  A photo takes 20-25 seconds.  A black and white page in draft quality can take eight seconds.  Initial pages in a set can take longer to print after the printer is first turned on.  Again, this is probably not atypical for a printer within this price range.<br /><br />Overall, this printer gives you exactly what it promises. The product's specific features are well laid out in the product description listed on Amazon.  Succinctly, however, this is an easy to use and easy to install, wireless home printer/copier/scanner.  This printer accomplishes basic tasks that would be required of it in a non-professional home office/casual use environment.  This printer seems to be a safe buy that should offer reliable and hassle-free"

1569144,352217,"got my unit on Monday (about 5 days ago).  It was very timely, because the next day I was attending my small children's holiday concert at their pre-school and this gave me a perfect chance to try out the device.    On the plus side, the packaging was decent, the product came with a nice plastic protective cover and the form factor and functionality were intuitive and easy to use.      The immediate cons were that the instructions (if you can call them that) included in the box are laughably basic.  It's literally a hard to read (tiny letters) pamphlet, and basically not very helpful.  However, it was enough to figure out how to use the device.      While the device is sturdy enough, I did not care for the design of the \\""flip out\\"" USB connector, it felt a bit flimsy.  Unfortunately, this connector seems designed to use more so with a Laptop than a desktop in terms of the configuration of the USB connector since the device hangs off of it.  Fortunately, there was an extender cable in the box (a plus), however, the device seems not to be able to charge through the extender cord (at least it did not for me).    The Video quality is decent (in the HD+ mode).  However, the biggest issue I experienced right away was that the AUDIO and VIDEO were out of sync when I transferred any of the recorded Video files to my computer.  It played properly on the device, but when I transferred the AVI video files from the VADO to my PC or laptop (I tried on two different computers to make sure it was not just my machine at fault), the sound played correctly, but the VIDEO went too slow: i.e., the sound and the video did not match up.      I tried a variety of things including looking up the product on the CREATIVE website for this product. Unfortunately, this section of their site is poor from both a quality and quantity of helpful content perspective.  There was very little there and really no way to even look up a phone number to call.    Fortunately, through Google I found their customer service phone number listed by someone else (Why not make it accessible from their own website?).  I called the number and it was quick in terms of being able to get to a human being (sounded offshore). The person had a good demeanor and tried to be helpful.  She walked me through a couple of possible things to try in order to fix the issue.  Unfortunately, none of them worked and apparently my device (which was just released) already had the latest software.    I was on the phone for about 45 minutes.  Since nothing worked, they actually suggested that I return the product to Amazon.com as the only solution!  This is in fact what I ended up doing about 3 days after I received my Vado HD.  I am disappointed that it did not work out and I definitely don't have any use for a video recorder where the sound and video don't sync up.  Good riddance!  Not having tried any of the other competing devices like the Flip Mino HD, I can't make a comparison, but as for the Vado - ultimately - it was a disappointment.  I will think twice about purchasing a creative product again (at least in the video category) after this C+ experience with the Vado HD.    ___________    Post script:  I was a bit annoyed that the videos I shot during my trial period were out of sync - SO I tried to figure out how to fix the issue with the videos of my children.

If you pay ten times the cost of this unit, you can have 20-30 times the interior space in a good quality, real safe (i.e. it actually locks!), in which you CAN put firearms and other items not recommended for this so-called \\""safe.\\""  Plus, no one can get into your valuables in a real safe or just pick up the box and walk out.<br /><br />Summary: I find this to be a very expensive piece of what appears to probably be just concrete inside of black molded plastic, with a lid that simply sits on top of an otherwise open box.  Yes, the lid and the top rim of the box have some overlap to keep if from easily sliding around, but that's as far as it goes.  I'm happy it can withstand a fire as described, but to pay this kind of money for what likely cost the company only a few dollars to manufacture, seems to be a true rip off.  And this is the harshest review"

Just being honest here, but there does seem to be a strong focus on this built within the unit. Others will offer more valid opinions on this topic that this review"

So if your willing to do a little work and get through the growing pains......buy this. When I get my new unit I will only activate the live service, I will not update the map. Ill wait a while for that.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Received my new TomTom today and with a quick call to customer service, they deleted my defective unit from my account and added the new one ( you can only add 1 new device to your TomTom account once every 6 months) so the live services work just fine.

1607557,3111567,"got the product home, I set it up just like the manual said: I installed the software first, then I plugged everything in. Software installation was SLOOOOWWWWWW. I am used to Logitech products, and the drivers for them are usually a little slow to install, but I could have installed the drivers for Logitech twice over in the time to install the drivers for this set. I don't understand why the install was so long because the keyboard does not have any advanced functions in it. After the installation finally completed, I tried to type with the keyboard and got nothing. The mouse was working, but not the keyboard. I troubleshotthe device and found out that only the mouse was paired to the receiver, and not the keyboard. So I manually paired the mouse and keyboard to the receiver and then they worked. Why couldn't Microsoft have sent the set pre-paired like almost every other wireless desktop manufacturer does?    Then when I tried to use the set, I noticed it acted strange. I took a quick look at the settings, and that revealed that even though I had chosen \\""Microsoft Wireless Multimedia Keyboard\\"" as the device (and this is the label that was on it), the installation chose a completely different wireless combo as the device, and the keysets were all wrong.

1611514,2583733,"got this unit as a gift and I’ve had it for a week now and it’s doing the job.  I live in an apartment on the top floor so my unit tends to get pretty hot by the time I get home from work.  I’m in the Seattle area and we are experiencing an early & hot summer so this unit is definitely coming in handy.  I will turn it on at 5pm and turn it off at around 8pm as to not bother my downstairs neighbors as it seems that’s when they usually go to bed (I also picked up some Anti-walk Silent Feet http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00536VQE0?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00 to help with the vibrations on my floor/their ceiling).  During the day I leave my windows open to try and keep my apartment as cool as possible.  When I turn the unit on it usually registers the room temperature at about 85 degrees (outside will be about 88-92 degrees); after 3 hours of running on the highest fan speed the room temp will drop down to about 73 degrees and my bedroom is around 300 sq. feet.  That may not sound like a lot but 73 degree air without humidity feels great compared to the rest of my apartment and it’s only been running for 3 hours.  I just need to get my room to a decent temperature so that I can fall asleep comfortably.  I believe it will allow me to set the desired temperature for 61 degrees and it may very well hit that mark if I were to let it run all day/night.  Another reason I don’t let it run all night is I’m a very light sleeper.  When it reaches the temperature you set it to it will turn off, when the temperature in the room increases by a few degrees it turns on again which will make some noise and wake me up.  The unit isn’t extremely loud or anything but going from total silence to the unit starting up is enough noise to wake me up.  Noise is relative and what one person views as slightly noisy another person will view as extremely noisy so it’s something you will have to judge for yourself.  The remote is nice and works as expected.  It is a little heavy; I think with the packaging it was about 86-90 lbs but I didn’t have much trouble lugging it up the stairs.  It does have wheels on the bottom of the unit so this makes it very easy to move from room to room if you need to, just keep in mind that this unit is only rated for an approximately 400 sq. foot room (14,000 btu units are good for about a 600 sq. foot room).

Foreshadowing obvious and not so obvious is rife as early sections have Cusanus ominously speaking of a strange woman about to be burned as a witch.<br /><br />Jeschke's time travelers are memorably compared to \\""dogs on a subway\\"". They have little idea how their time travel system works or who built it or why, indeed little beyond some basic features they can exploit. Jeschke cleverly uses not only standard scenes of dialogue to explain things but epigraphs from cosmologists and artificial intelligence researchers like Albert Einstein and John Wheeler and David Deutsch and Cusanus himself to rationalize by suggestive speculation.<br /><br />The plot, like the balls of Cusanus' game, veers all around. Poignancy and suspense can quickly change to farce. Long travelogue sections suddenly become quick cut scenes of impending doom as Domenica goes on missions into time with both professional and personal ends. Why time travel dooms romance among its practioneers is laid out.<br /><br />Some set pieces aren't strictly necessary. A frail old woman tells how she alone survived years of isolation in space after a doomed Mars mission. Wheelchair bound veterans battle youths in Amsterdam street riots. But I enjoyed them as well as Jeschke's extended extrapolations of virtual reality and nanotechnology.<br /><br />In the middle of the book, is a chapter called \\""The Cusan Acceleratio\\""and previously published as a short. It's a quite detailed timeline of an alternate history and integral to the book. It's also understandable to see why Jeschke says it was the most difficult section to write.<br /><br />Not so integral to the plot are the several almost identical scenes with Cusanus. I understand the purpose: to show how alterations in timelines affect Cusanus. However, I think they could have been shortened, and that was the book's only flaw for me besides some predictable German phobias about nuclear power.<br /><br />The ending is powerful and unexpected. The narrative stops in quite an unpredictable place.<br /><br />[Review"

The measurements are very easy--1/4 teaspoon for every cup of food at every meal. I highly recommend gradually adding this to your dog's food if you know your dog is a little finicky.

1664681,2197387,"sential product of a truly traumatic childhood. In short, she was believable in her role, and her manic paranoia and edge-of-sanity actions set the tone of the frenetic race to identify and stop the monster terrorizing her.<br /><br />There is a lot going on in this book. The timeline is a bit jerky and there are a lot of different characters to keep track of, so some parts were a little hard for me to follow in places. I can't say I totally bought into the introduction of Auggie, either. His behavior wasn't exactly what I'd call professional and his connection to September strained my willing suspension of disbelief. Overall, though, this is a layered, grim, freaky thriller that kept me riveted from cover to cover. And the reveal of the Bad Guy completely blew me away. I did not see that one coming at all.<br /><br />As out of left field as it was, it completely worked, and all those niggling little bits of seemingly random story detritus so carefully doled out from the very beginning coalesced into a horrifyingly shocking snapshot of insidious evil by the end.  Disturbing, maybe, also effective and intelligently done.<br /><br />I wish this hadn't been labeled as a romantic suspense, though. For all that Liv was a great main character, and her damage made her realistic and believable, I don't think it made her a great romantic heroine. She was just a little too broken for me to really engage with her in a romantic role. I liked Auggie quite a lot, and I liked them working together, but I kept wishing she wasn't quite as unbalanced as she was, or that the relationship between them had evolved a little differently. I just couldn't get a grasp on them as a couple, not for where Liv was when their relationship started, anyway.<br /><br />It was the biggest stumbling block of the read for me, and that, along with some of the stylistic elements that tripped me up here and there throughout the story, kept this from being a solid win for me as a romantic suspense. That doesn't diminish my frank appreciation and admiration of the book as a taut, seat-of-your-pants, gut-kicking psychological thriller. In that regard, it'sone of the better ones I've read recently, and one I think fans of the genre would enjoy.<br /><br />Disclosure: An ARC of this book was provided to me by Zebra publisher Kensington Publishing Corp. via NetGalley.

While the web site is visually attractive, it is often difficult to find the tools I am looking for. I thought the web site links for additional information were poorly labeled and I couldn't find any comprehensive guide on how to use the armband-monitor unit or features of the data subscription service. I consider myself to be above average at figuring out technology. Persistence enabled me to eventually get signed up and performing the basic functions. Even after discovering some of the other data-based features and reports, it is often difficult to find them again. I purchased two units so that my wife could try it too. While she also likes it, she needs help in figuring out anything but the mostbasic functions. I'll mention that she did graduate from Stanford Medical School so it is unlikely that she is significantly lacking in intellectual ability.<br />Our monitor units work fine, but could have been so much better. In order to use the unit, you will first have to figure out how to sign up for the subscription service. The first three months are included in the initial price but BodyMedia requires a preauthorized credit-card approval for an ongoing subscription to begin. The user will be required to pay for the subscription service in order to have continued access to the data after three months.<br />We had trouble trying to figure out how to use the Bluetooth connection to our phones. I contacted customer service and received a detailed set of instructions which I followed but was still unable to get the Bluetooth to connect. I followed up with customer service and rather than getting any further support, I received a reply that only said: \\""Yours in health.\\"" I later realized that the models which we purchased do not have Bluetooth capability.<br />I do not use the calories consumed function. Since I usually prepare my meals myself rather than consume pre-packaged food, it takes too much time to calculate for the volume of each of the ingredients to my meals. My wife does enter her meals and says it takes her quite a bit of time and could be much simpler.<br />My wife sometimes works away from home and on her current trip, her armband monitor would not sync with her computer. She later found that she only needed to re-enter her login because when she went away, she changed internet connections. As is typical with our experience with BodyMedia, there was nothing to clearly prompt her that in order to download and review"

1675982,2950029,"got this product yesterday, 12/28/13, and of course, I had to test it out right away. I was, unfortunately, too confident in using this curling wand at maximum heat (410 degrees), and, halfway through my hair, I slipped up, and now have 2nd degree burns all over my hand.<br />I wasn't paying attention when I was halfway through my hair, and upon switching the hand that held the wand, I grabbed the scalding hot barrel instead of the handle. I suppose I must of went into shock because all I was thinking was how it felt like my hand was melting like butter and I couldn't pull myself together and put the wand down fast enough.<br />I spent the remainder of the day in massively agonizing pain which felt like I was still holding the burning hot wand. I now have ten blisters all over my palm. Although this mishap occurred (and it was pretty much my fault, of course), this product still deserves the rating that I gave it!<br /><br />Now, for the reason behind my rating. I give it 5 stars because it gave me perfectly beautiful, flirty curls! I have extremely thick and very long hair (25-30 inches); and even doing 2 inch to 3 inch sections, I still got tight, bouncy, ringlet curls. It is a great product! Heats up practically instantly, and curls hair in as little as ten seconds per section. The real deal maker for me was that I slept on the couch with my curly hair, woke up with still curly hair, spent over an hour playing with my hair, and now I'm writing this review"

1680742,3412701,"receive this product, once I did, and the more I read the instructions, the more discourage I became. After years of just plopping in a new filter and running it for several minutes, I can hardly believe all the steps it takes for the AQUA OPTIMA ‘CLARION’ WATER FILTER PITCHER.<br /><br />However, in actually going through the process, I must say that it is much quicker than I thought it would be, as well as the water goes through the filter faster than the pitcher I had in the past.<br /><br />For each pro, there seems to be a con.<br /><br />Pros:<br />• The water drips quickly through the filter.<br />• Soaking the filter initially takes ten minutes – much short that some I’ve had in the past.<br />• The container is a cute design and pleasant color.<br />• Easy to pour.<br />• There is an opening in the top lid to add water.<br />• Easy to put together.<br /><br />Cons:<br />• Have to initially soak the filter.<br />• When you put a new filter in, you have to fill the picture twice, dumping out the water before you can use it. A waste of time and money/water. However, I guess when you have to run the faucet for several minutes before using a new filter with a faucet filter system; you are wasting water as well. At least this catches the wasted water, so you can give the water to your pet or water your plants with it.<br />• The container is small, requiring refilling it with water often, if you drink lots of water.<br />• You have to fill the top container twice, before it fills the bottom.<br />• You are to dump out the water if not used in 48 hours. That seems like a waste.<br />• The dial for usage if not well designed –though a nice idea. You can only put the number of the month the filter will be no longer be good. Since they are good for 60 days, say you put a new filter in the middle of May, you would set the dial for July. Without having the exact date, you may not recall when in May you put the new filter in. This may lead to changing it out too early, or too late in the month. Either way is not a good scenario.<br />• It doesn’t filter fluoride. Even though the description claims that fluoride is needed for our health, there are tons of documented information stating not only do we NOT need fluoride, it’s actually harmful to us. I plan to make the switch to a filtration system in the future that takes out the fluoride as well.<br /><br />Product Information:<br /><br />• Capacity 5 cups<br />• All Aqua Optima products are BPA free"

I brewed my first batch, fully expecting to have mediocre tea.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the brewed tea.  I purchased the Zarafina white silver needle and black golden monkey tea, and both have turned out spectacularly.  I have spent quite a bit of time in England and have become spoiled by how good their tea is, and consequently haven't liked anything I've had domestically.  To be honest, we just don't put the importance or effort into tea the English do, and it is usually reflected in the taste.  This unit does a pretty good job of coming close to English tea.  (I'm sure there are some Englishmen out there that will argue the Earl Grey point with me - that is why I've used the word \\""close\\"".  Go easy.)  Keep in mind the quality of your tea will affect the outcome - you're not going to get amazing Earl Grey out of this thing if you use Lipton bags.

Namely, the remote &#34;button&#34; setup was not showing up on myharmony.com, so I could not customize any buttons to perform actions to switch between inputs, which took away the main advantage of the smart control. Also, for my TV, the smart profile that it installed knew how many inputs my TV had, but it didn't realize that the first press of the input button only brings up the menu, then subsequent presses actually switch between inputs.<br /><br />After holding for about 35 minutes, I finally talked to someone with Harmony (Logitech) customer support. The person on the phone was pleasant, congenial, and totally useless. I also emailed tech support several times with different questions, and as of this writing have never heard back (that was two weeks ago).<br /><br />I finally found answers through search engines (of course), and the glitch with the account was fixable by forcing the unit to &#34;pair&#34; with the remote again, which refreshed the unit in myharmony.com, and the issue with the button presses was customizable within the devices menus, which allowed me to both add the additional needed button signal and speed up the interval between presses, which keeps the menu from disappearing before it has made it to the right input, another one of those early frustrations I had.<br /><br />Anyway, if I was only review"

Through a process called hydrolysis, the starch is reduced to its basic amino acids. Then an enzyme is used to break it down even further, resulting in a powder that instantly dissolves in water. People who are allergic to gluten should be aware that maltodextrin can sometimes be derived from barley or wheat. Per the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act (FALCPA), all FDA-regulated food products that contain maltodextrin derived from wheat must include the word \\""wheat\\"" on the food label. In the case of USDA-regulated foods (meat, poultry, and egg products), this warning is not required on the label, so beware of products such as soups with meat in them which say they contain maltodextrin. However, products such as jams and jellies--and a powdered product such as this one--which contain maltodextrin, are required by law to say \\""wheat\\"" in the the nutrition labeling if the maltodextrin is derived from wheat.

1749324,2359595,"get the unit in the window and turned it on.  I found out immediately that my thoughts about the smaller fans, higher fan speed and noise were true.  This thing is LOUD.  Super loud.  And buzzy.  In fact, I'd go as far as to say that it is downright unruly.  There is no chance you would use this in a bedroom even on low speed.  The controls were easy to use although not completely intuitive.  There are three speeds available on each fan - low, high and super high.  You have to set each fan separately, which I think is stupid.  I cannot imagine a scenario where I would want one fan on high and another fan on low, etc.  The temperature setting dial is also extremely stupid.  There are no temperature markings.  According to the manual, you are supposed to keep the unit on until the room reaches a temperature that you like and then turn the dial back until the unit cycles off.  Seriously?  Each fan has its own direction switch for either intake or exhaust.  The power cord is located on the bottom center of the front of the unit and its mounted too low so that it interferes with the bottom of my window frame.  Who is designing these things?  The one feature it had that I liked was that the grilles were directional and could be rotated to direct air in a 360 degree arc.  On the power consumption front, this unit used twice the power as the Holmes! - 97 watts on low, 109 watts on high and 120 watts on super high.  My unit was defective in that the switches for the right fan are wired incorrectly such that low is high and high is low, but super high is still super high... odd.  Returning.  Due to the noise level, I would not recommend this unit.  I cannot understand how it has 4 of 5 stars and as of today, 262 review"

When I have my Blu-Ray player off and instead turn on my DVR, this device automatically senses that and feeds that signal to the same HDMI input on the TV.  The device works automatically once installed and you do not need to manually change it.  Nevertheless, it has a little button on it that allows you to manually change it if you wish, selecting whether you want HDMI input one or HDMI input two to feed to the HDMI input on the TV.  The device also has two little LED lights on it to let you know which HDMI signal is being sent to the TV.  There is no remote for the device and I do not think one needed since it works automatically.  Another plus is that it operates on its own power so no need to plug into any power source.

While the actual experience is kind of horrifying, listen to the lines being delivered so woodenly. There's a script holding all this up, and it's a damned good one. Luke and Andrew Campbell and Stacy Silvers wrote themselves a story that's got legs. Had Project Greenlight been around back in the day, I think they would've taken a long look. There are levels to this thing. There are plots, subplots, sub-sub-plots, with everything ratcheting around to look kind of like everything else; they've taken a lot of classic mystery-novel conventions and grafted them onto a horror-comedy. Great stuff.<br /><br />While I'm tangentially touching on that subject, that's the other thing-- once you get past the diction, this is a very funny script. It tries too hard a lot of times, but every once in a while there's a one-liner that actually had me laughing out loud at my computer screen. That does not happen, unless I'm watching weebl and bob. Period. The trying-too-hard is common for neophyte scriptwriters, and I have confidence these guys will eventually get over it. They're also very good with sight gags; about half an hour into this movie is one of the funniest scenes I've come across in a horror film recently, which involves a couple of uberdorks (played by the Campbell brothers) treating a delivery pizza like a seven-course food orgy from a Henry James novel while serial killer Richard (played by Maidens) is hacking up the delivery guy in the other room. Yes, as with the rest of the movie, the special effects are cheesy, and you have to be there to get the full humor effect, but think about all the subtext you can pull from a scene like that. Campbell does it justice.<br /><br />This is a first effort from a bunch of kids who, if there is a movie god, are going places. They're not Romero, Russo, and Amplas yet, but they're giving it the good old college try. I liked this movie a whole lot better than, by rights, I should have, and as long as you're not too squicked out by the gore factor (you know those shots that got cut from the final release of Dario Argento's Jenifer I mentioned in that review"

1791238,1520369,"get this item which is reported to be the same exact unit as the old Westco made by EastPenn Deka with the exact same dimensions. Since mine was the first generation Miata with round vent tubes, the venting outlets should also fit perfectly.<br /><br />I ordered the item straight from BatteryMart, which uses Google checkout. They also shipped out the package the same day they received my order in the morning. As I need the battery to start my car, it was much appreciated.<br /><br />However, UPS delivery had a problem since the address was missing my apartment number. I called Batterymart since I was sure I entered the apartment number in the original order (shown in email confirmation), batterymart rep claimed that I would have to pay a $10 fee to correct this error, which I found outrageous (regardless of whose error, since it's really just a simple call to UPS to change the information).<br /><br />After explaining and verifying that it was something amiss between Batterymart and Google Checkout that they used, the manager was able to \\""waive\\"" the address-change fee. A bit cynical, I asked for a discount, which the manager named Anthony was nicely able to get (probably through Google) a day later by waiving my shipping charge.<br /><br />Then the package finally arrived, even though it was delivered to the wrong building (again fault of UPS). The carton looked worryingly small, barely bigger than the battery. Opening it, the suspected problem unraveled: The package was padded by 1/2\\"" of spacer at the top and two longer sides (not four), but the bottom was only padded by a single layer of thin corrugated board with a few crushed shipping foam peanuts. Two corners of the battery was thus damaged, obviously pushed in with creases in the plastic and outer box.<br /><br />I called UPS to file a damage report, but also contacted BatteryMart via email. I think the damage is as much attributable to UPS as it may be to the woefully inadequate packaging. The battery had been tested to have the proper voltage and appeared functional, though I was not sure if these damages would have repercussions in the long term. I will update if I get a follow-up from the vendor (or not) on replacements or compensation.<br /><br />Also notable is that the top of the battery doesn't really look like the one in the Amazon photo, which looks exactly the same as the old Deka/Westco battery. The one I received has a slightly different design, arguably looks a bit cheaper with plastic layers instead of an entire block with grooves as the hold-down bar guides; although it's a minor quibble. I also cannot verify from any of the markings that it is indeed made by East Penn (except the shared 81MU1R model number which is also shared with an Autozone wet cell miata battery among others, telling nothing of its true origins).<br /><br />Nonetheless, it is an AGM as there are no watery slushing noises, or this sort of damage with the package obviously been rolled around would probably have caused a leak already. The hold down clamp in the Miata also fits perfectly over the plastic top pieces. The battery is the exact same size as the old Westco, fitting nicely into the battery tray as well, with some room left over (as Westco is a bit smaller than the original Panasonic AGMs).<br /><br />I have searched various sources for the proper AGM battery, and most are either much more expensive, or have been replaced by Wet-cell types that are serviceable yet undesirable due to Miata's peculiar battery location in the trunk. It's a pity that if not for the damages, I would have declared this my new source of replacement Miata batteries.<br /><br />8/20/10<br />Batterymart responded to my email, less than a day after I dispatched my request.

1796872,2675844,"get this product for my new Droid X and even ordered it directly from Seidio for the full retail price (because they had them in stock sooner).  There are nice aspects to the case/holster pair, but the case that I got won't stay together very well.  I don't know if that's because of quality or design.<br /><br />First, what I like about the pair:<br /> - The case has a nice feel to the exterior surfaces.  It feels comfortable and soft, and it gives good grip.<br /> - The holster and case fit snugly together, and I haven't noticed any wiggle at all.<br /> - The belt clip.  One of the big reasons that I got it, as I love the convenience of being able to quickly put on and take off accessories.<br /> - The added piece of mind that I won't scratch up my phone when I carry it around or have it in my car.<br /><br />Now, what I don't like about the design/quality:<br /> - The case that I received has a critical flaw in that the left edge doesn't stay rigidly connected.  With the touch screen, it's pretty often that I'm swiping my fingers from side to side.  Therefore, my fingers will bump into the raised edges of the case around the screen.  On the left side, the connection between the two halves of the case is loose, so that edge moves around and begins to separate when I touch it.  I find that annoying.  I don't know if this is a quality issue or a design flaw.<br /> - The initial fit and finish of the case edges weren't very good.  They were sharp and jagged in places.  After rubbing them with my fingernails for a bit, they did smooth out.  For fifty dollars, though, I expected better.<br /> - This may be an aspect of any case for the Droid X, but I don't like how the front buttons are harder to push because of how close the case edges are to the buttons.  So, perhaps not a cut against this product, but just a comment for those looking at getting a case for the Droid X.<br /> - The top clip on the holster doesn't seem to fully open and stay open.  Honestly, this might be me not knowing how to use it properly, but it feels like mine will break if I try to open it any further.  Assuming it won't snap open, the clip is spring loaded and naturally moves to the closed position - which is perfect once the phone is inside.  When inserting or removing the phone, though, the touch screen faces the clip, and the clip could hit the screen if it slips loose from your fingers.  If you're careful, it should be fine, though.<br /><br />Based on DroidBoy's review"

1807286,2027,"get the product so this wasn't much of a concern, just a minor annoyance.<br /><br />Physical Product:<br />What I really enjoyed about this razor was that it had 5 sharp blades and you could definitely tell you were getting a close shave and I definitely got a super close shave the first few uses!<br />I also liked that the handle wasn't too bulky or awkward to use. It didn't take up a bunch of room in your shower which was nice.<br />The in-shower storage holder was worthless. It literally fell three times and I finally just gave up on using it. The suction cup on the holder just didn't hold up at all. The awesome thing about it though was that the moisture bars didn't budge even though the razor kept falling! I was pretty surprised how sturdy they were and I wasn't expecting that.<br />The pivoting head on the razor was super flexible and made it easy to get every part of your leg.<br /><br />Travel:<br />If you travel quite a bit, there is honestly no good way of taking this razor with you. I went on a business trip and couldn't bring the razor because it has no protective covering for the blade head. I was too afraid the shave bars would fall off in my suitcase so unfortunately I had to leave it behind.<br /><br />More on the moisture bars:<br />The scent of the bars smelled amazing. When I first saw the name of the scent before smelling it I was a little worried it would be sickly sweet, but it was definitely a pleasant smell and thankfully the fragrance didn't irritate my legs.<br />As far as it having Olay(tm) moisturizer in the bars, I wasn't impressed. I have a problem with my legs getting super itchy after a shave if I don't use any moisturizer after (and sometimes that doesn't help). I was expecting this product to feel moisturizing and reduce the need for a ton of moisturizer slathered on my legs. Compared to other razors, it did a little better with not being so itchy, but it was honestly nothing amazing. I was quite disappointed by that.<br /><br />Use:<br />I have used competitor brands' razors that feature moisture bars so I knew what to expect and what to look for in a good razor with moisture bars. If you have never had the chance to try out a razor with built in shaving cream, they are a MUST HAVE! You reduce your shaving time in half and the Gillette® Venus was no different. Since there were five blades, I got a seriously close shave the first few times of use.<br />Unfortunately, after a few uses the moisture bars started to wear quite a bit and the last time I used it, I had to go over my legs with another razor because the shave wasn't as good. Gillette® claims that the razor blade head is supposed to last up to a month, key words \\""up to\\"" because they definitely didn't last me a month! I have to shave every few days and found myself using other razors because the moisture bars wore so quickly.<br /><br />Another few things I don't really enjoy about the moisture bars is that they can only really be used for your legs and underarms. If you want to shave your bikini area for summer, good luck with that. I own four razors because I have ones with moisture bars and ones without for different areas.<br />BUT I think its completely worth having a razor with moisture bars because I definitely don't want to mess with shaving cream (an extra expense and waste of time) if I don't have to! With the moisture bars that step is taken away and like I said earlier, you LITERALLY reduce shaving time in half!<br /><br />Although the moisture bars can wear pretty quickly, its something to expect with this product. I think this product is good, nothing amazing and has room for improvement, but overall they made a good razor. The five blades and non-bulkiness really beat the competition,but there are some things that could be improved!<br /><br />Would I buy refill razors for this product and continue using it? Probably, but it has a lot of room for improvement. Its an awesome concept, but I think to beat its competitors it could improve a lot more! But then again, the competitors need a lot improvement too. Its definitely a good contender for a razor that features moisture bars though.<br /><br />I was sent the Gillette® Venus and Olay(tm) razor via a program run by Gillette® Venus for my HONEST review"

Gable was under contract to MGM but had been making trouble for them so as punishment Louis B. Mayer personally loaned him to Columbia for this film. <br /> <br />The film had a lot else going for it; a motivated Capra, a great script that would play well with small town America, and a good ensemble of supporting talent. The story concerns a spoiled young heiress (Colbert) trying to escape the control of her father (nicely played by Walter Connelly). Dodging her father's private detectives she takes a Miami to New York bus where she meets a recently fired reporter (Gable) who agrees to help her in exchange for an exclusive story. Cozy quarters and many adventures lead them to change their initial opinions of each other (brainless brat and obnoxious bully) as an undisclosed affection develops. On theeve of their arrival in New York they try to sort out their feelings for each other. <br /> <br />While the script is not really successful in convincingly illustrating the process of their falling in love (one minute they are just friends and the next they are in love), Capra is able to sell it with a simple connection process between these two characters which is at work throughout the film.

Here is where the first issue begins....the buttons (scroll arrows up, down, right, left) are WAY too sensitive and thus you are moving around even if you dont want to.  So I start to set the date...without paying attention....and I quickly notice that the format for the date is dd/mm/yy which is primarily how the eastern part of the world uses the date.  I finally figure out that my mind is lacking without coffee and I get the date and time set....  Lets move on.<br /><br />The camera notifies you that you can hit the play/pause and trash buttons simultaneously to get back to the setup options.  Works perfectly.  In the setup menu you are presented with the following options:<br /><br />Time/Date<br />Video Quality<br />Instant Record<br />Anti-Flicker<br />Tv System<br />Language<br /><br />Most of these are self explanatory. The ones with options are as follows:<br />Video Quality: HD+, HD, VGA<br />Instant Record: On / Off<br />Anti-Flicker: 50hz/60hz<br />TV System: NTSC/PAL<br />Language: English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Portugese, Dutch, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Bahasa (Indonesia), Turkish, and Arabic<br /><br />The main screen shows you what mode you are in (record, ready, etc), the available recording time, the mode (hd+, hd, vga), and a battery meter...these are at the top of the lcd screen.  The bottom of the screen shows the date (dd/mm/year) and the current time.<br /><br />When looking at the LCD the mini hdmi port is on the left hand side of the unit and the right hand side has a power button for on and off.  The usb connector is at the bottom....folded into the body with a tab sticking out so you can pull the connector out.  There is also a standard tripod hole.<br /><br />The shooting begins....I tried taking small clips of things inside the home as well as outdoors (although with the weather up here its not worth standing outside more then 4-5 minutes :-) ).  I shot completely in HD+ mode as there are a lot of units this size that do regular vga and hd....  The image quality on the lcd screen was superb...even when outside under the sun I was able to see what I was shooting.  This I like.  My issue still remains that the rocker buttons are way too sensitive and it was driving me nuts for a while until I was able to mentally adjust the pressure I was applying to them.<br /><br />The viewing begins...  I plugged the mini hdmi to hdmi cable from the camera into our 46\\"" Sharp Aquos 1080p LCD Panel.  The playback was indeed 720p/1080i as the unit should do.  It was flawless and the quality of the video stunned me.  I loved it.  It was comprable to the Flip Mino HD.  Of course, I need help with my stability...since I noticed that movement was apparent...but hey this is no image stabilization camera...

Furthermore, PC-based systems allow for multitudes of options for advanced flight and racing sims, with far more complexity than any options available on consoles.<br />-Setup was easy.

The earphones come packed in a hinged aluminum case, with the Painted Tunes logo etched into the aluminum in the same color as the headphones they sent me - bright orange. Catchy I suppose. When the case is opened the orange headphones are nestled in there along with a similarly colored container in the shape of a tube of paint to store the earphones. Slightly ridiculous. The cord is thin and wide like a wide pasta which supposedly prevents tangling (I agree, it does) but it does look odd. Maybe this whole thing is marketed to 16 year old girls, but I'll play along if these things sound as good as the manufacturer says they will.<br /><br />Short answer to that - they don't. They are a little bass heavy but that is not the problem. The manufacturer says &#34;Each earbud is individually machined out of 100% aluminum, creating a rigid sound chamber for pure, high-quality sound without distortion. Go ahead – crank up the volume.&#34; HaHa, couldn't be more wrong. These sound like garbage and the more I crank it up the worse it gets. The sound is muddy and unimpressive, worse at higher volumes.

1867182,2756049,"get a unit that takes both the large size CO2 tank or the small one - that way you at have options (which I discuss below under CO2 tanks). I really prefer the larger tanks so I don't have to refill as often. However, they are more of a pain to store and lug to a retailer to exchange (or box up and carry to post office if doing mail exchange...). I suppose if you don't drive or have lifting issues then the smaller tanks would make more sense. There are other considerations regarding the different tanks as well:<br /><br />CO2 Tanks:<br /><br />Where I live, Sur La Table is the closest source to buy and exchange the CO2 tanks, and they ONLY exchange the small ones. In fact, the lady there claims all the retailers except Costco only do the small bottles. Well, I've not been to every retailer to confirm this, but I do know that bed bath & beyond also exchanges the 130 litre tanks as well as the smaller 60 litre. It would be a real bummer if most all the local stores only exchanged the small tanks, but even if so, I'd still want the option to fit the large tanks too. The reason being is that you can always order them directly, and, if you're willing to chance the paintball tanks and refills, there is a gadget you can get that will adapt your soda stream connector to fit those kinds of refillable tanks: [[ASIN:B00CU0E73O SodaMod SodaStream Soda-Club CO2 Adapter - Save Money on Refills- Made in the USA- 100% Guarantee]] it's expensive up front, but if you use your soda maker as often as I do the cost for the device would be paid off in just a couple of months or less. Those who use the paint ball refillable tanks (which are about 120 liters from what I understand) claim they can refill them for only $5.00 (which is obviously much less than the tank exchange cost of a soda stream tank).<br /><br />Flavors:<br /><br />I can't say anything about the flavors/syrups as I don't use any of that stuff - I only like unflavored super sparkly water. Although it does seem most of the mixes have ingredients I wouldn't want to serve to my family, so you might want to look at that if it's a consideration.<br /><br />Problems I've encountered over my 8+ years using soda stream:<br /><br />1. There've been times that I've encountered some sort of quality issues in the past, and that's usually when I've quit using the system for awhile (but I always go back within 6-9 months or so...). for awhile I was having bottles that didn't hold their fizz - I think there may have been a year or so the bottles just weren't as well made or something. I've also had times where I could've sworn my tanks had about 1/2 the gas they were suppposed to have (again, this was a few years back, and this seems to have been fully resolved).<br /><br />2. If you live somewhere really hot it doesn't seem to work as well. But again, I don't pre-chill my water, so this likely would be resolved if your water is pre-chilled.<br /><br />3. My soda stream fizzy water goes flat much sooner than Perrier, but about the same as other sparkling waters. Perrier is naturally carbonated, so this may make the difference. However, it doesn't seem to go flat any sooner than the artificially carbonated store bought waters such as Calistoga.<br /><br />4. If you don't like the taste of your tap water, you won't like the taste of it sparkling either. There is definitely a taste difference between Perrier and my soda stream sparkling water. The last place we lived I quit using my soda stream because the water there just tasted funky. However, we recently moved (thus, I acquired another soda stream maker) and here I really enjoy the taste. Some taste aspects can be filtered out with a water filter, but not all - it's pretty much trail and error to figure that one out.<br /><br />The bottles:<br /><br />1. Cleaning - I really, really, really wish I could dishwash the bottles. I use both the 1 litre and 1/2 liter bottles. The smaller ones I carry around and drink directly out of as if it were my bottle of Perrier I was carrying around (you're picking up on the fact that I love perrier, eh?). So because I'm drinking directly from these they get funky sooner (human mouths are much more contaminated than that of your dog or cat - that's why human bites can be terrible for infections, so just imagine all that on the edge of your bottle...). I then use the larger bottle for refilling my small ones in a pinch, or for serving folks that come around and want some sparkles. Hand cleaning the threads and lid of the small ones before each fill isn't too terrible, but I'd feel better about it if they had the intense cleaning of my dishwasher.<br /><br />2. The 1/2 liter bottles  - I love, love the size of the 1/2 litre bottles. However, I've encountered something on the 1/2 litre bottles I've never had happen before on any other of my Soda stream bottles. I have the orange and green bottles, and between the colored part on the bottom and the clear plastic there is a line of mold about 1 cm down from the top of where the colored plastic piece sits. I think the colored plastic piece is a tad too bit at the top, allowing water and microbes to get in, then it has a super tight seal about 1 cm down and the microbes move in and set up shop right at the point where the plastic is too tight for them to go down further (see the picture I uploaded). While this isn't getting into the water I drink, it is really gross. I've ordered another set in a different color and we'll see if it happens with those 1/2 litre bottles as well. My larger ones are all just fine, but they're too big to carry around, so I hope this issue can be sorted out. I suppose on the larger bottles with the black plastic this may be happening and it just isn't visible because the plastic is black. However, my current larger bottles are gray and they do not have this mold issue.<br /><br />Competing products:<br /><br />Primo & Cuisinart:<br /><br />There are other systems out there for less money and that allow use of the paintball refillable tanks.

1870858,1760908,"got this unit for my non-technically inclined and visually impaired mother. But with only power, volume, and 6 station preset buttons she can easily operate it. The Aluratek however has nested menus which are more confusing.    The clock display on the Aluratek is bigger and more easily read without your glasses. The clock display on the Squeezebox is smaller, only runs when the power is off, and gets miniscule when the radio power is turned on. The clock stays on when the Aluratek is powered up. The display on the Aluratek is REALLY bright and can light up a whole room at night. The intensity is not adjustable, only the duration.    The Aluratek is designed to be a clock radio. The buttons on the top are bigger and easier to locate in the dark or when you are sleepy. The buttons on the Squeezebox are on the front and smaller (and more numerous)    The Squeezebox updated itself immediately upon connection (took an hour!) but the Aluratek update is completely manual. I tried to do this but was unsuccessful; maybe this was because it already had the latest firmware. Some way to know the version on the website would be nice, then you could compare that to what is onboard the radio.    The Aluratek comes with extensive documentation in English and French: quick start guide, manual and a CD, but the Squeezebox comes with only a brief quick start guide.Overall impression     I give the Aluratek 4 stars, taking off points for the poor FM radio, the non-adjustable backlight and mediocre sound quality on the internal speaker. The Squeezebox Radio gets 5 stars...see my other review"

Creative on the other hand, would not replace a set of speakers I owned when 1 of them stopped working well within the warranty and they also refused to replace a MP3 player that just stopped working, also well within it's warranty period so, burn me once shame on you, burn me twice shame on me.

I find them full sounding and am not disappointed at all. They go really loud and I haven't even been loud enough to get distortion...and I've been loud.<br />The ONLY issue I have and may be typical to just me is that I would have liked a deeper bass sound, not easily achieved without a subwoofer I imagine. Don't get me wrong, they have good bass for a portable bluetooth speaker but it's nothing to call home about. I don't think I will get the 'perfect' bluetooth speaker system until I'm willing to spend $190+ and I'm not at this point as this is MAINLY going to be used as a travel component (for hotel stays) and for bedtime music.<br /><br />If price is not a concern with you at all, you may want to look into else.

1900823,976498,"got this product while pregnant.  My husband's iPhone is out of contract, and he plans to buy a new phone.  I see parents at restaurants propping cell phones up for babies to watch, to keep the child distracted and quiet.  One of my coworkers who has a toddler sometimes has her at work for about an hour at a time after day care closes if his wife can't pick her up, and lets her play with his phone to keep her occupied while he works.  I think it's inevitable for me to let my baby play on a phone.  I also remember playing games on an Apple IIe as a toddler, while sitting on my mom's lap.  I remember the game and my mom.  It is possible to interact with the child while they play with any toy, or just to limit time with a toy so that the child gets a variety of experiences.<br /><br />Here are observations on the toy so far:<br /><br />Easy to put phone into:  To put the phone in, you turn a dial and pull out the plastic panel on the front, then put the phone in and put the panel back on.  A spring holds the panel inplace. It takes enough pressure to turn the dial that I don't think a small child could easily take it apart.  At the same time, it was easy for me to do.<br /><br />Touch screen works, even under plastic:  Once the phone is in, some rubberized knobs hold the phone against the plastic screen.  The touch screen still works through the plastic screen.<br /><br />Easy to clean:  Because the case completely encloses the phone, and the case without phone has no electronics, you can wash the case.  You can wipe a phone down, but not wash it.<br /><br />Turning phone on and off while it's in the case:  With iPhone 3gs, we couldn't turn the phone on after it's in the case.  You can get to the flat front of the phone while it is in the case, but for the phone I am using, I need to press the button along the top of the phone to be able to turn it on.  I have to turn it on while it's out of the case, then put it in.<br /><br />Apps seem fine for babies: Baby Photos and Roly Poly are the 2 free"

1903953,1502100,"receiver units can sit on, below or near your speakers (mine are on the base stand). The positive and negative wires run from the receiver unit to the speaker and the receiver unit plugs into the closest wall socket. The furthest I had was five feet, but it was in an area no one walks. Push the button on your transmitter unit and voila! The sound is just as good as the wired system. It will even transit through furniture - you don't need a direct line of sight for great transmission. The system detects other transmitters that are using the same 2.4GHz frequency, (cordless phones, Wi-Fi routers, microwave ovens). This \\""Advanced Adaptive Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (AAFHSS) technology\\"" constantly monitors several channels at a time and continually switches to the strongest available frequency. The signal is never interrupted.<br /><br />I do want to point out that on my initial sound set-up, one speaker had a slight buzzing, so I rechecked the wiring, turned it off and then on again. Now they sound just as good as if they were running through wires. I tested them with Pink Floyd's \\""Dark Side Of The Moon\\"". I live in a condo on a concrete base in a valley of sorts, so I do not get a lot of interfering signals. However, I do have a microwave, an internet, an OOMA for phone use, a cell phone and a neighbor upstairs and next to me. I've had no trouble with the sound. In layman's terms, the receivers (at the base of the rear speakers) sound fantastic. If I were in a high rise, I would imagine it might be different, but KEF transmittors constantly change frequencies to adjust for this interference.

And when running Netflix I got audio but no video.  Did more research and it appears that there was an update but that Asus pulled it, presumably because of other issues.  Unfortunately Netflix was a deal breaker for me.  I kept the unit for a couple of days hoping that a corrected update would be released but now the unit won't power up.<br /><br />For me this model had really nice potential but ended up being a real disappointment.  I guess I can hope that an update will come out for the Memo Pad that I currently have which will address the audio/video sync issues with Netflix.

The apk does not overwrite the current install and the message it gives you \\""Netflix is not installed.\\"" is not accurate.)  After installing, Netflix worked perfectly.

But wait...there's more...  It seems Netflix in the Google store just came out with an update to address problems with the some devices.  So I uninstalled the sideloaded Netflix, did the update to 4.2.2., installed Netflix from the Google store and all is good in the neighborhood.  My son is smiling from ear to ear (he's got a smile that lights up a room you know).  Been just a few days but so far so good.  Not sure what the deal was with the other unit eventually not powering on and I have seen others with similar problems so I am cautiously optimistic.

As instructed I planned on upgrading the firmware so I skipped as much of the setup as I could knowing that the unit would be defaulted, I got to the network portion of the setup process and punched in my wireless info, the receiver connected to my network, and then a message popped up about a firmware update. I clicked OK and the receiver downloaded and began upgrading the firmware. The upgrading process took about an hour to complete. Once the firmware updated you have to manually power cycle the unit.<br /><br />After the reboot the another message came on the screen about a firmware update. I thought that was odd since the recevier was supposed to be defaulted, but I did it anyway. About an hour later the firmware update was completed and I rebooted it again and that was the final message about firmware updates.<br /><br />I then tested things out. I was fairly impressed with the ease of setup of the receiver. I'm not a home theater junkie or an audiophile so I left most of the settings at the defaults. The things I messed with are the auto-off, the &#34;extra&#34; HDMI ports, and the HDMI pass-through. The pass-through is why I bought this device in the first place. My wife watches TV and doesn't use or want the speakers on so this was a big plus. Once it was setup it worked great - for about 3 weeks.<br /><br />One night my wife turned the TV (without the receiver) on and there was no video or audio. I had her turn the receiver on and we heard the audio from the show she was watching. I moved the HDMI cable around to different inputs on the TV and the same problem persisted, I plugged a tablet into the HDMI port on the TV and it worked, so the issue was the receiver. For the time being, I just bypassed the receiver so she could watch TV. I began to search around and found that I was not the only one to have this issue. It seemed to be across many models of Onkyo receiver but the complaints all revolved around the HDMI pass-through and no video, no audio, or no audio/video at all. The simple fix was to unplug the receiver from the power outlet and plug it back in. I did that and sure enough it worked right away. Further google searches revealed that the HDMI pass through issues were fixed in OCT-2012 with a firmware update. Wait, I already updated my firmware twice - did I discover a new issue?<br /><br />As it turns out, I didn't discover a new issue at all. The firmware that was released in OCT-2012 was not available as an OTA update, but USB only! So I went to Onkyo's website, downloaded the firmware onto a USB stick, plugged it into the front of my receiver, and updated the firmware. Again, took about an hour and claimed to default my settings (which it did except for the network settings). Been running on this firmware for about 2.5 weeks now and no issues, but time will tell.<br /><br />A negative is how this receiver functions with my harmony remote. I have an Xbox and a PS3 connected and I use the EXTRA1 for the PS3. You can't seem to program the harmony remote (at least I can't) to change the receiver to the extra HDMI ports at all, so I need to keep the Onkyo remote handy to switch over to the PS3. No big deal but it would be nice to use just one remote. Yes the 8 HDMI inputs are nice but the extra jockeying around you have to do to get to the two extra ports is kind of a rub. Also I can't seem to sign into spotify - pandora works just fine. Although I haven't tried spotify since the last firmware upgrade.<br /><br />This turned out to be a lengthy review"

1963809,835474,"get key items, and then there's the Toy Box mode, which almost counts as a second game. It's aseparate area from the main game that you can select on the menu, and here you can customize a toy town, go on tons of little quests for other toys, earn new characters to populate it with, and unlock numerous trophies. It's very well made, and I spent way more time here than I did with the story mode.    All in all, the story mode is pretty good. It tells the story of the movie with a couple of big parts taken out, or characters removed probably due to copyrights (the cymbal monkey is nowhere to be found in ANY TS3 merchandise, and the game continues this trend). A lot of the levels are based on things in the movie, like the first level being from the imagination/pretend opening in the movie with Woody trying to stop Dr. Porkchop. They're fairly simple to navigate through, but the camera is what'll screw you over more often than not, usually when you have to time a jump just right to a moving platform. It got so bad in one level to the point where I had to just stop playing for a while, cool down, then return a few hours later and try another 30 times before I made the jump. This doesn't happen -too- frequently, but when it does, it ruins the flow of the game. The camera will be positioned a little too high or low, and since you can't move it around with the shoulder buttons of right analog stick, there's no fixing it. The other problem I have with the game is that a couple of levels drag on for way too long. The roller coaster rail one where you play as Woody comes to mind immediately, and I slunked in my chair when I found out I had to collect more batteries to finish the level. Luckily everything in the Toy Box mode is problem-free"

1965084,102955,"got this unit factory refurbished from Woot for $50 plus shipping (deal of the day, I think.) I have never used Apple TV or any of the newer models, so I can't really compare to those units. I do know that it has a much better interface than my Sony BDP-S580, Wii and PS3. Even setting it at 720p on an HDMI output, it has a better picture on most videos played. Some seem to be slightly hazy or pixelated. I watched about 8 hours of video on Netflix today without ever losing my connection. I noticed a change in video quality once or twice and just figured it was my connection trying to maintain its speed.<br /><br />Okay, as soon as I entered the wireless setup, it told me that I had to switch my router to MAC Address filtering and gave me the unit's MAC address. It would not connect until this was done. Not hard to do; just went to my router's diagnostic page online and fiddled with the Wireless settings. Of course, I also had to add the MAC address of every wireless device in the house in order for them to connect to the WiFi again. Wired connection setup automatically without any settings changes. I did have to go online to sign up for an account and to activate each channel individually online. When I signed up for my account, it gave me an option for using a credit card or my PayPal account. I use PayPal or the PayPal debit card to pay for everything anyway.<br /><br />Once this was set up, I never had one bit of trouble with the wireless connection. I do have a Westell modem + router in one combo unit, so that may have resolved some of the connection issues that others have had. When I first set up the unit, it was in my entertainment center, only about two feet from the router. I later moved it to my parents' bedroom, thirty feet and two walls away. The connection was the same: 4 dots with the HD confirmation. I haven't tried many channels except for Netflix, Hulu Plus, Amazon Prime and Pandora.<br /><br />This really is a great unit, but there were a couple of things I would have liked to have seen improved. The remote literally has about 10 buttons. There's no reason for it to be so sluggish with some of the commands. The Hulu Plus channel does have the option for CC on or off (my Sony BD does not), but the Netflix channel does not have this option. Seems like an easy fix with the right update. No reason to have to upgrade the entire puck to get this part right. A power switch/ON-Off button on the remote would've been nice. I haven't tried PlayOn yet, but I intend to, if only to get CBS, TNT, TBS, USA Network and Syfy on my Roku box. Until then, my parents will never get rid of Dish.<br /><br />EDIT: Playon wasn't worth the price of admission. Each channel only had about 5 episodes of each show. Mostly, not even current or even consecutive episodes. I've also noticed that the remote is so damn slow to respond! I've had to unplug it and let it reboot after free"

First thing I did when I received this unit was to try shaving after a shower -- worked perfectly.    - Speed: For my old shaver, I had to take several passes, and yet still missed stubs here and there. With the Vortex, I was able to shave cleanly in one quick pass. I'm impressed!    - Head Pivots:  The head of the shaver adjusts smoothly to the contours of my face.    - Battery life:  Right outof the box, I used the shaver for a month before it finally ran out of batteries.  I shave about once every other day, so seems like this could really last for those long trips!    Cons:  - After my shave, my skin got a bit irritated. However, I'm sure my skin may just need a little time to adjust.  (Edit:  My skin seems to have adjusted perfectly.  I would now give the product a perfect 5!)  - Came with a cheap travel bag.  - The cleaning/charging unit is fairly big.    ---    Some review"

1975378,2985013,"given this product 5 stars.  I really do.  In some respects it deserves even more than 5 stars.  For example, the packaging. You may not pay much attention to these things, but Fekkai clearly did. This is the most attractive packaging I've ever seen for a hair product. The bottle comes first packaged in a tubular cardboard box. Once that is opened, you pull out an absolutely beautiful light blue teardrop shaped glass bottle. But the best thing of all is the dispensing system. When you unscrew the top, it activates the dropper attached to the top and automatically draws product into the dropper. So basically all you need to do is unscrew the top and you are ready to dispense the product by simply pushing the button on the top of the bottle top. One or two droppers full is plenty for shoulder length hair.<br /><br />The product smells exquisite. It is, without a doubt, the best smelling hair product I've ever used. It's a warm vanilla smell - think fresh baked sugar cookies.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the performance of the product was not quite as good as an inexpensive Suave product which I review"

I attempted to report this to BD tech support but the process for doing so where it automatically picks up info to send hung in istelf for about 20 minutes before I lost my temper and rebooted.

I know this is implemented to add depth to the endgame, but I bet it'll get a bit tedious.<br /><br />>>>SKILLS / CUSTOMIZATION: There's only one skill to enhance for each of the earlier levels, and later, there are only a few runestones to shift, so it's easy to assume the skill system is oversimplified. Well, at level 30, I have to say the skill system gets much more interesting as you start getting into the higher levels. I've changed my position on the ease of 're-spec'ing characters, and think it's actually a value-added change. It's nice being able to swap skills, and having the system set up like this actually encourages strategic adjustments for different bosses / areas. Having this sort of setup means you're not going to be unique in your build -- and that means you're going to be more generic, and so will everyone else. Still, with so many various build possibilities, it's pretty unlikely you'll end up in parties with people exactly like you. As you get higher up in levels, it's nice to see different classes' strengths and weaknesses emerge as well.<br /><br />>>>MUSIC / SOUND / VOICE: I was turned off by the music at first, but like it now. Each installment in the Diablo series goes with a subtly different soundtrack theme. Diablo III seems to be going for the more 'epic' feel, vs. Diablo 1's spooky minimalism and Diablo II's mood-setting tracks. Different, but actually pretty good. Sound effects are okay, nothing special. Voice acting is absurd. Skeleton King andNPCs in Act I a case in point. Good lord. Compare the Skeleton King's lines in D3 to Diablo or Mephisto's lines from D2. See the difference? Diablo 3's voice acting is excessive and vaudevillian to Diablo 2's atmospheric minimalism. Sure, the lines could be silly in D2 as well, but at least you didn't have extended cartoony dialogue from the bosses like in D3.<br /><br />>>>SOCIAL / DRM / ONLINE: Blizzard did a pretty good job making it easy to find and add your friends, and to invite them to your party/game. A big disappointment, though, is the failure to include voice chat. What the heck? Even 5 years ago, a console game could take voice chat for granted. Blizzard should have seen the value of voice chat when hundreds of thousands (millions?) of their WoW subscribers turned to Ventrilo or Skype or other similar applications to support voice chat between party members. I'm disappointed with this being left out of Diablo 3, especially since it's online-only. If it's online-only, we're supposed to be playing with friends. If we're playing with friends, let us talk! Chat isn't as important in single player, but then if we're going to play solo, why make us have an internet connection? Pretty weak. I've been using Google Plus 'Hangouts' to chat with my teammates, and that works well.<br /><br />>>>TECHNICAL ISSUES: the server bugs seem to have been resolved in the week since launch, but many of my friends still have connectivity or graphics/system issues... getting booted from games, losing connection, computer free"
